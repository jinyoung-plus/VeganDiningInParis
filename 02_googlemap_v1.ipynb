We spent some time at other vegan places on our trip, but this was the best one by a long way! The staff were so friendly and inviting, really helpful, and fun as well. They really care about making you feel welcome and cosy. We decided to both have the no chicken tacos which at first seem quite expensive, but when you try them, they are 100% worth the cost. I'm more than happy to pay for this quality of food. The flavours are amazing, the produce is so fresh and locally sourced, and you can tell they have taken time to create the perfect balance of ingredients.

They offer a several staples that are the available every day (biriyani, samosa, daal, korma, spinach etc), but then the veg curries change every day. I absolutely love that everything is freshly made daily and the veg dishes change every day. I'm always finding new dishes to enjoy. Some of my favorites have been their eggplant sabzi, the okra, and string beans. Plus they offer the traditional South Indian foods like dosas, vada, idly, and idiyappam etc. The food is authentic so some of the dishes are spicy, though not everything is. Also, all the food is a great value for the money. I love it.\n",

They seem pretty into raw foods, they have raw desserts and even a raw pizza but not a raw salad on the menu (other than a tomato salad which is just sliced tomatoes so that's not a meal but more of a starter.) Since I was looking for a nice raw salad, I ordered the kale salad but removed the quinoa and sweet potato. Without those however the value at 16 euros was not there for the quantity given. So it would be great if there could create a nice raw salad, even using ingredients they already have in the kitchen for the correct price and quantity. I'm only giving it 3 stars because although I love the concept, the setting is beautiful, and the servers are kind, the food was also way too salty. I've had r salad two times in the last few months and both times were way over salted. I hope they can correct these things so I can update the score.

      "리뷰 내용: This vegan restaurant in Paris offers well-crafted and beautifully presented dishes, though the ingredients and recipes lack originality. The service is attentive and helpful, enhancing the dining experience. However, the tables are bare and napkins are thin paper (and only one is offered). Worse is the restroom, located in the courtyard, which is in dire need of maintenance, which detracts from the overall experience. Additionally, the €4.5 charge for carbonated tap water, labeled as \"micro filtered,\" feels excessive. While the food and service are commendable, these inconveniences could affect repeat visits. Ultimately, at these prices, there are better alternatives.\n",

Despite everyone receiving buzzers to indicate when their food was ready, not a single one went off in the time I was there, & every group had to go back downstairs to check when their food would be ready.
