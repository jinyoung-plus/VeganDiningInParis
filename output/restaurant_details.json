            "非常好吃的一家，想说吊打上海一众bruch。店主人蛮好的，做的东西也好吃，尤其是pancake，沾上糖浆简直好吃到爆炸，现做的就是好吃啊！还点了一份有topping的toast（好像是这个），蘑菇和豆腐干的topping真的太好吃了...祝店长早点把店开到上海！！\nReally nice food, hope your guys open this restaurant in Shanghai lol! It really worth.",
            "During a recent visit to Paris my partner and I were super thankful to have Kitchen close by to our hotel in Marais. The space was cute and the food tasted healthy and delicious.\n\nFirst, yes the space is small but not abnormally smaller than many of the cafes in Paris. We didn't encounter any issues getting seated, but it was quiet in Paris at that time, so plan ahead!\n\nWe both got the veggie stew, which was a large bowl full of fresh and roasted veggies, avocado, and tofu. We also had a chai tea, pumpkin spice latte, and banana bread. It was an extremely satisfying and delicious lunch.\n\nFinally, the staff was really friendly and accommodated our poor French skills with their much better fluency in English. Much appreciated!",
            "Have had breakfast here every day while visiting Paris for the week. I keep ordering the pancakes with gorgeous, red fruit compote & sliced bananas. The fried egg adds some yummy protein to the meal. The staff has been extremely friendly. After hearing them speak to each other and other customers, I'm impressed with their ability to switch from French, English, and Swedish so effortlessly. The ambience is friendly, lively, and comforting. Love it here!",
            "Good/fast service, great price, and delicious breakfast.\n\nAmbiance was chill and quiet.\n\nSmall location but a good experience",
            "I ordered the Avocado with gluten free pancakes which came with a hummus paste and feta cheese. All of this was accompanied by a fried egg and green salad. Quite a delightful surprise, as the cafe is cozy and unassuming. I also started with a chia pudding stuffed with berries. I would certainly eat here again and it's a great change from baguettes and croissants which I still love."

            "The food was amazing, to the point that my boyfriend had to come back the next day. I went to 4 different countries and in each country, I was trying to find delicious Eritrea food like the one I had in Atlanta; it took me to come to Paris and try this spot where I found the flavors, taste, heat, deliciousness, variety, and high-quality I was looking for.\n\nEven dining the first night, we went around 5 pm, I was so sad no one but us was in there, but by 6:30-7 pm, people were rolling in and I was so happy that it was getting the recognition it deserved; by the next day going back again it was packed!\n\nParking would be sorta easy to find, and the decor highlights the natural beauty of Eritrea, in a small mom/pop shop style. Extremely homey and cozy feel with attentive hospitality.\n\nNow trying to find a place like this in Philly!",
            "Second time visiting this place while in Paris (first in 2016) and it's still a great spot to satisfy a craving for Ethio food in a tourist and budget friendly environment.\nAs is traditional, we shared a large platter of assorted appetizers and entrees, with a little help from our host in making selections, when we opted for items that were known to have some possibly unclear translation on menu.\nEveryone loved the food, the relaxed atmosphere and amazing value for the $$.\nTotal bill for 3 with a very nice bottle of Bordeaux came to about 60 EU.",
            "I crave Ethiopian food in my hometown & so deliberately sought out this spot while visiting Paris. Mom & Pop type place. Nothing fancy, but food & service was good. Satisfied my craving ; )",
            "Had high expectations based on some reviews I read. First they refused to honor the Yelp check-in offer. Not sure if it was a language barrier, but the waiter didn't fulfill the order correctly and was very rude when I provided feedback. The vegetables were served lukewarm and lacked seasoning; spinach tasted like it was frozen, not fresh. Didn't finish the meal. Not good value. Will not return. I've eaten at many different Ethiopian restaurants, so I'm very familiar with the flavors. This was the worst dining experience I've had in Paris.",
            "This place deserves a round of applause for awesome customer service because our waitress was so kind the entire time- even when my dining partner didn't quite like the food. It was his first time having Eritrean food (or anything like Ethiopian food for that matter) and he couldn't get over the taste of the injera. It was too sour for him, which is understandable for somebody's first time.\n\nI really enjoyed the food actually! Everything tasted fresh and like it was made at home. In particular, I liked the cauliflower and the potatoes. We had the lamb as well and it was so good. The chicken leg was also great and had a lot of flavor to it. I thought that everything looked and tasted delicious.\n\nHowever, since my friend couldn't eat very much, I was left to eat a gigantic portion and didn't feel very hungry to begin with. The waitress was very sad to see that we didn't eat very much and asked us if we would like to try something else. She tried very hard to make things better for my friend, which I thought was very sweet. In the end, she understood and boxed everything up for me to take home with a smile on her face. It was so nice of her and I loved eating the leftovers for dinner and lunch the next day! The food is definitely worth the price- it was enough for three meals! I will definitely be back."

            "I was super excited to find this place in order to enjoy some French classics in plant-based form.\n\nWe dropped in for lunch and when we arrived, shortly after noon, we were the first guests. A few other parties trickled in through the course of our meal.\n\nThe menu has many appealing dishes but after narrowing everything down, GF ordered the onion soup and seitan bourguignon. I ordered a vegan \"roast\" with the side of potatoes.\n\nI'm not going to bullshit you, nobody is going to confuse this onion soup for the real deal but once you get past that, it was absolutely excellent. You're hearing this from someone who doesn't like onions or beef broth. I wanted to just try it but ended up funneling half of it down my gullet.\n\nThe roast was pretty good, as were the potatoes and what I assume was a creamy cauliflower \"salad\" like side. It was nothing earth shattering but enjoyable and I really appreciated having a vegan meal considering the vast majority of the offerings in this city.\n\nRegarding the beef bourguignon, GF says: \"it was very tasty\".\n\nI will add that the service was...just ok. It was pretty quick and prompt but in stark contrast to the welcoming and friendly service received elsewhere in the city.",
            "Excellent service and very friendly staff.\nIf you are vegan (or if you have a vegan friend) this is the place to go. The friendly staff will explain all the plates.\nExcellent decor, great organic wines, and very interesting and flavorful vegan dishes.",

Manioc gave the soup some solid mass - but mostly this was just pure over-the-top coconut milk goodness.\n\nAn Aveyron salad was an orthodox French salad with a generous mix in of strong very high quality Aveyron blue cheese.\n\nVery fresh walnuts were a fine taste contrast.\n\nOh yes - and plenty of healthy greens for the salad.\n\nThe rest of the table all had Berber plates.\n\nThey\n\na) Loved them and\n\nb) Couldn't finish them.\n\nHaving so much food you can't finish it is a good thing in a vegetarian restaurant.\n\nAll of us having had a super rich coconut soup first may have had something to do with this.\n\n* * *\n\nOverall, a first rate vegetarian restaurant.\n\nHaving something this good in the epicenter of the tourist zone in the Latin Quarter?\n\nSeems implausible ... but it is here and it is good.",
            "I dont understand the 3.9 rating. This restaurant had amazing food and service. After a tiring 2nd day, we stopped by here since it was relatively close to our hotel and had veg options. My husband and I ordered their gratin dish and a tofu and seitan platter. The serving size was huge for Paris but we finished it all. Also got some cold crisp beer.\nOur server was an Imdian lady who was efficient and friendly. Its a small place and tables can get cramped but that just adds to the charm that is Paris.\nI was glad to try some French veganized dishes here. Coming from California, I thought it was very reasonable priced.",

            "Awesome find for vegetarians or vegans that omnivores in the group enjoyed, too!\n\nI ordered the veggie burger. It was a housemade patty topped with vegan cheese. If I lived nearby, I would be a regular customer just for that burger!\n\nMy husband chose the blue cheese veggie burger and really liked it.\n\nWe tried the tart apple pie & waffle with ice cream for dessert. If the waffle was a little crisper, it would have been perfect.\n\nWe did not have a reservation, but we were able to get seated right away at a small table for 4 outside.",

The right number of check-ins, the pacing of serving the food was on point. The food itself was delicious. The plating was not fancy but who cares when it's so good!!!

That s a big downer right off the bat.\n\nHappy hour drink prices are reasonable.\n\nThe food is ok... I ordered the œuf poche à la bordelaise (Bordeaux a poached egg) and the Dos de Colin fondue de poireaux, sauce vierge ( Black hake with leeks and virgin sauce). It s a bit salty but will hit the spot especially when one is hungry.\n\nThere s not a line here and that should always be a clue....\n\nThe service is basic. The waiter seems more interested in attracting cute ladies passing by than clients... lol... he should be a bouncer at some club instead.\n\nThe view is on the famous Bachir Ice Cream place.\nNow, check that place out when you can for dessert!"

            "Absolutely outstanding and super-fun vegan restaurant.\n\nMassively original dishes with an African touch and a mad original genius touch.\n\nSomeone insane is in that kitchen -and we should be very happy that maniac is there.\n\nIf you are a normal reasonable rational person, you would order one of the dishes on the menu and be very very happy.\n\nBut they offer a rice table option where they will bring you a bowl of rice and bowls of EVERYTHING they got in the kitchen.\n\nOMG.\n\nDecadence on a stick!\n\nAmong dishes you will never forget:\n\n1) Waffles with sweet potato and vegetables. Chicken and waffles has met its vegan version - and the vegan version is better.\n\n2) The best spinach dal you will have in your life. Tastes more like spinach than anything spinachy you have ever had.\n\n3) Beet Hummus. Beets make everything good. Even dipping food.\n\n4) Mango Masala. Because sweet is good.\n\n5) Dragon Curry. Time to have the top of your head blown off. But this is so so savory! You need a little mega-fire to keep everything balanced, right? This is a vegan establishment, so there is no actual dragon meat in the dish.\n\n6) A tabouli that will make tabouli haters love tabouli.\n\n7) Black Panther. Edamame and vegetables. A bland counter to the other crazy stuff. But don't miss the black rice at the bottom!\n\n* * *\n\nIf you get the full rice table, you also get dessert.\n\nTheir chocolate peanut butter mousse is the peanut-iest dessert you will ever eat in your life.\n\nThey make everything from scratch in their own kitchen.\n\nSo peanut butter here just means ground up peanuts.\n\nThe chocolate is a binder and a \"straight man\" to play off the peanuts.\n\nThe chocolate is almost like the chocolate in a mole.\n\nHow is chocolate peanut butter mousse as a dessert?\n\nJust as insane as everything else in this amazing establishment!\n\n* * *\n\nI am sure Paris has haute haute haute fancy vegan restaurants for people who just have to have fine crystal and expensive silverware and lots of ou-la-la.\n\nI don't care how tootie-pa-snootie the room is so long as the food is good.\n\nThis was a vegan meal we are going to remember for the rest of our life.\n\nAdd to it the fun factor of eating all these different things on top of the same bowl of rice ...\n\nAnd this is Vegan Party Time - Only Totally Gourmet!",
            "You can't really go wrong with a vegan restaurant called rice rice. The food, setting, and service all contributed to a fantastic dinner.\n\nRiz Riz is conveniently located in Marais and has a fairly large space--a number of tables, many of which could accommodate larger groups. After checking for our reservation, my partner and I were quickly seated and offered the choice of an English menu (thank you!)\n\nFor food, we settled on the \"rice table\" which was a bit of a smorgasbord of several dishes on their menu. It came in 8 decent size bowls, with another bowl of rice for each of us. There were a few stew/soup style bowls (which were all delicious), some that focused on chickpeas or edamame, another with sweet potato waffles, and one with an incredible beet hummus.\n\nIf it sounds like a lot of food, it was, even for two people. We both walked away very filled up, though stomach's happy. Pricing was reasonable too, keeping the wallet happy as well. And if you want to keep the night going, there's plenty of places nearby to grab a drink. Cheers!",

Nothing was actually tasty yummy!\nVery disappointed !",
            "What a wonderful place to have a sampling of Asian appetizers for lunch on aa wet, partly sunny in Paris on a January afternoon.\n\nWe were staying near the area and happened to pass by this place as we were searching for a place to grab a bite. It's a small indoor cafe, but two things stuck out: the friendliness of the greeter (who we later found out is the owner) and that the dumplings were being handcrafted fresh by ladies right in front. We were seated at the last available seating for two, and there was a carafe of still water right there (with a sprig of mint for flavor). The restaurant emphasizes the fusion element (mainly between Chinese-dim-sum and Japanese Gyoza). We got two plates from the 'Les Compositions' menu: Menu (Dim Sum) Star (15.90€) and Menu Gyoza (14.90€). The Gyoza plate came out first, consisting of 4 meat dumplings and 4 veggie dumplings (you can tell the difference by the color of the wrapper). The plate also had medium grain rice, and seaweed salad, and a dipping sauce (soy vinegar). The dim sum plate came in two personalized size steam baskets that came JUST out of the steamer (all of it was very freshly hot, which was great). It came with rice, dipping sauce, and edamame (which is why it is called fusion, I guess). Everything was good, very fresh, and steaming hot. Obviously it depended on personal preference for fillings (we both like meat fillings a lot more than vegetarian). The size was perfect for the two of us for lunch, and we finally sated our (good) rice fix after a 12 day absence.\n\nAs we were finishing, the greeter came over, and asked us to write something in a guest book. Kinda neat, so my wife wrote a nice greeting. We learned that she was Anne, the owner, and when she noticed that we were from Cali, she pointed us to a different guest book that had been signed by a famous California resident. We struck up a conversation, and paid by credit card. We left the restaurant really happy (it helped that the sun peeked out as we went outside as well). Ann was really cool, and love how a place like this exists (probably all over the city) without much hoopla.",
            "Chez Ann is such an amazing gem hidden in a less crowded part of the city. I've traveled to Asia and have traversed the NYC and LA food scene and Chez Ann by far has been my absolute favorite dumpling shop.\n\nThe atmosphere is really really nice and feels modern and fresh. The presentation of the food is superb. The selection is great and features some dumpling fillings that are more unique than your average dumpling shop.\n\nMy boyfriend and I split one of the combination options that let you try a little but of everything. My personal favorites here are the soup dumplings and the squid dumplings.\n\nThe Chez Ann team did an amazing job and I enjoyed watching the prep that went into the food with their open kitchen. Seating here is a bit limited but it's perfect for small groups or couples.",
            "The food at Chez Ann is amazing! They have great veggie and vegan options! The food is made quickly in house with great flavor. I would highly recommend",
            "This is a difficult review to write because when you think of dim sum, you think of cheap food, quick and delicious. All of the dim sum here is hand crafted and you immediately notice the amount of effort Chez Ann puts into each piece. While I do appreciate the effort, they flavors and choices doesn't scream dim sum restaurant.\n\nYou're extremely limited in choice. They have a few varieties of dumplings and egg rolls but that's pretty much it. No har gow, chasu bao, or chicken feet etc. It's classified as a dim sum restaurant on Yelp and Google but don't be fooled. This isn't your traditional dim sum restaurant. It's more of a restaurant that has dim sum.\n\nThe price point is definitely not worth coming here. You're better off spending your money elsewhere. €3.50 for one measly soup dumpling - that's definitely a no for me.\n\nWhat blows my mind is that they charge €4.95 for 4 pan fried dumplings!\n\nAvoid this place if you're looking for dim sum like you would find in the states or Asia."

They were very accommodating as it was crowded (Saturday night) and we came late. After some interesting discussion with the people we sat near, we enjoyed our dinner. The menu is still hand written on the board as they only serve what is fresh that day. We enjoyed the Onglet De Beouf. Was prepared perfectly and served to order. The wine selection is still varied and will satisfy any taste.\n\nI cannot recommend this Bistro enough. Thibault is truly a special host and the locals really do make you feel at home.\n\nDo yourself a favor and take time to visit. Tell then i sent you. LOL.",
            "Not even sure where to start but here we go...........We arrived very late Thursday night for a Bistro (22:30) looking for a local place to get food. We were warmly welcomed and sat immediately. The location is small (seats maybe 20) but comfortable. It was still very full with a mix of 25-75 year old customers and conversing in various languages.\n\nThe wine list is on a board that hangs near the door and covers several whites and reds. The menu is on a chalkboard as it changes every day. it is mostly Veterinarian but carries a meat dish or two as well. I love that idea personally as a small place with minimum storage you need to shop daily and as you would always want the freshest ingredients (disregard the other reviewer that stated frozen).\n\nThibault (the owner and front of the house) had the biggest smile when he came to our table and was amazing. He heard me speaking explaining the french worded menu in English and spoke spoke to us in English the whole time. We both ordered the bolognese lasagna that came with a small side salad. It was perfect. It was like a home cooked meal which is exactly what we were targeting. We enjoyed it with a wine he recommended to us and was also perfect. It was the perfect local Bistro experience.\n\nFast forward tot he next day. We were doing what tourists do all day when it came to a point to start thinking about dinner again. We both kinda laughed and came to the conclusion that we needed to go back and try more food at Bistro Ernesto. This time we arrived earlier and the bistro was again quite full. We found a mixed menu of some of the same items from the day before and a few new items. we started with the Frommage platter (various cheeses) and the Caucisse Seche (sliced cured sausages). They were amazing. For dinner, she ordered the lasagna (it was that good) and i ordered the Saute' de Veau Marengo Penne. WOW! If this is ever on the menu i HIGHLY recommend it. After dinner, we decided to go to the small bar area for an after dinner. This ended up a great idea as we met several locals that were just amazing people. All had different stories and backgrounds and were very accommodating with our limited French speaking.\n\nThis is what a bistro is supposed to be like. I wish more owners were like Thibault and understood that. Prices were fair. Selection was varied. Food was great. People were amazing. Do yourself a favor and go to this place. Be open minded and friendly and what you will experience is a great dinner as a local and some time with new friends.",

As vegetarians with little experience with French, my sister and I were worried about eating much more than baguettes and jam (not that there's anything wrong with that) in France, but Bistro Ernest exceeded our expectations!! Our waiter was all too patient with us not speaking french and the food was AMAZING\n(got the vegetarian lasagna and the vegetarian plate!). Delicious, hearty, and healthy. Incredible wine and complimentary bread really made the evening!! And the atmosphere is great-- small, cozy, quaint with great music-- everything you'd want for a lovely meal in Paris!!",

We shared two entrees: herring on salad and the mozzarella and tomatoes. Both were excellent! A half carafe of rose and scrumptious baguette with truffle oil made it even better! Spent the evening talking with the owner, Thibeault, the chef, and several locals! They were friendly and made us feel right at home! We will have to return to try more of their food, it all looked amazing. Lovely ambiance and great wine!",
            "I understand people are charmed by this cute, tiny place with character and very affable service, I was too, but food is not good and overpriced for what it is. I had vegetarian lasagna that some reviewed on other sites as fresh and excellent- it was burnt or dried out on top and very dry, zero taste. We also had steak, which was very very tough and bad quality meat. I simply could not chew threw it so I had to spit it out into a napkin and give the rest to my husband. I asked for the steak to be a medium to medium rare, it was served well done. We also had penne pasta with mushrooms, it was ok. Everything lacked taste. We had creme brûlée, it was very good but the top was char black, not to my liking. We ate everything because we were starving. The best part was the baguette served with dinner. (-:"

Luckily, we ran into a British guy that knew exactly where a Cambodian restaurant was and out of desperation we agreed that would suffice. After he mockingly yelled, \"You want Chinese food here in Paris? Are you F@%ing jokin mon?\" and we all had a hearty laugh he pointed us to the right location.\n\nThe area was quant similar to NYC the real estate is hard to come by in Paris so we had to make way for a family of five right in the middle of the kitchen traffic, this was not pleasant but the food made up for it. Lot's of varieties to choose from, tasteful and although not a direct Cambodian fanny I enjoyed the mix of noodle, vegetable and curry sauce known as kroeung.\n\nYes, similar to Indian curry but straight out of the Khmer kitchen although, geographically it did not make sense....Indian curry in a Cambodian restaurant in the middle France they still came out with four stars after all why should I penalize them for my ignorance right?",
            "I was really excited to try Le Cambodge! I ordered take out. The woman who took my order was very nice. My meal was just okay. I ordered the Lo Lak, and the meat was very chewy. I could barely eat it. The rice needed salt. The spring rolls were good though!",
            "After a delayed and missed flight (my fault) we were very tired and wanted to have our first meal in Paris.\n\nSince I am very fond of the Cambodian cuisine and the French colonized Cambodia for almost 90 years, hoping to find some excellent grub.\n\nService was very disorganized and the server kept trying to talk us out of ordering items saying \"they are too big for the 3 of us to share\". I said it is fine I still want to proceed with the order.\n\nThe food and service were both a let down. The price was on the high end and we will not go back.",
            "My friend who's been at this restaurant a few years back dragged me here for a lunch break even though it was a bit out of the way from where we were sightseeing. They must be popular in the neighborhood and in high demand - we went to their two \"petit\" locations (which didn't serve noodles with soup) before ending up at this \"proper\" location. All three locations were within walking distance & owned/operated by the same people. I'm very glad he dragged me here. They served both Cambodian & Vietnamese dishes. We had the spring rolls, pho with fried spring rolls & Cambodian chicken soup (I didn't realize this was served with rice, I requested to switch it out with noodle) along with fresh lemonade. Everything was authentic, delicious, vegetables were super fresh/plentiful and the meat (chicken, beef, pork) was tasty & cooked just right. I can see why it's very popular. I would definitely come back again & pay my friend forward by bringing others who haven't been here. There was indoor & outdoor seating. Be warned, the tables were very close to each other, the chairs were tiny and the table was tiny - we had to juggle all our orders. Also, beware smokers if you grab an outdoor table. Everybody made it work though.",
            "When we found a Cambodian restaurant in Paris, we had to try it! We didn't expect the restaurant to look so classy and couldn't find it right away! They have an English menu. My boyfriend who speaks Cambodian was impressed with the way the Parisian servers pronounced the dishes.\n\nThe Shrimp Spring Rolls were good! They use very thin vermicelli so it the fish sauce really gets soaked into the Spring Rolls well. The Shrimp taste very fresh and sweet.\n\nSomlam Tchou was very sweet... too sweet and it was hard to finish. The flavor was pretty overwhelming.\n\nNom Peuchok was ok... it's a mix of coconut milk with curry powder. I'm not too sure how this dish is actually suppose to taste in Cambodia, but it was a little boring. The flavor was just coconut milk and there wasn't any interesting kick. Nothing that impressed me. There is some white fish in there, but it didn't accentuate the flavor :("

            "My friend and I went to Cafe Ginger for dinner yesterday - being gluten and dairy free I'm always super excited to try new vegan and gluten free places. Sadly I was quite disappointed.\n\nThe one room restaurant was entirely overcrowded with chairs, tables and people, not really creating the easy going and friendly atmosphere it seems they are striving for.\n\nThe food really wasn't up to standard either - which I was really quite disappointed about. To start I had a juice (kind of an odd starter if you ask me) and my friend had what we were told was gaspacho... it only just resembled it.\n\nAs a main we both chose the springrolls (they were the only gluten free option for the main). Whilst the ingredients were evidently fresh - which was what I was craving - it didn't make up for the strange overpowering flavour combinations and the simple lack of imagination.\n\nI'm sad to say that I would not reccomend this place to anyone - which is such a pitty as it is one of few vegan places in Paris."

            "Something that bothers me with French people (France and Quebec) is that none of their business hours are correct. I've come to believe that they start when they're ready to work, which at Les Bols de Jean it's 11:45am. However they did allow me to wait inside until the girl is ready to take orders. When she's ready, I ordered:\n\n1) chicken coconut curry with pineapple!!! Thick pieces of chicken, light coconut flavour, soft curry taste, and sweet pineapple together. Turned out to be sooooo good together with the bread. Without the bread it's pretty boring!\n\n2) ground beef with creamy creamy creamy bechamel gratinée, eggplants that actually didn't destroy the soup (I don't like eggplants so I'm sensitive to the taste), sweet onions. This also taste really good with the bread!\n\nThe buns are freshly baked each morning and delivered from the bakery of Eric Kayser. The menu changes daily. That explains all the preparation they do in the morning thus not being able to take orders.\n\nBoth soups were made to taste perfect with the toasty bun. The soft crispy bread definitely makes a difference!! It completes the creamy thick soup SO MUCH. It's not a runny liquid soup as I thought. It's more like a bread bowl with lightly flavoured and creamy sauce. Together it's really good.\n\nStaff is on and off nice. Generally nice people! Customers are not nice.",
            "***Disclaimer: I only tried the delivery***\n\nIt is a welcome change when you regularly order delivery - and believe it or not, despite them being served in a bread bowl, my dishes came with no disaster in the bag! Yay!)\n\nI had the tomato & ricotta bowl (€8, veggie) and the beef chef bowl (€13 - a kind of hachis parmentier). I liked the veggie one better, but that's down to personal preference - my boyfriend enjoyed the beef. Only downside: they don't offer all their desserts in delivery, only fruits - and my €3.50 apple and pear compote was not great, too sugary and not homemade.",
            "Very interesting concept! Friendly staff, very willing to customize food to your choice. I would've definitely given a higher rating if they could've provided more choice for vegetarians. Definitely recommend the place for at least one visit."

            "This is the third of the \"Le Cambodge\" series of restaurants - the first two are on the other side of the Canal and one of them was unfortunately one of the targets on the November 2015 attacks here in the city.\n\nThat aside, this is the smallest of the three, but serves the exact same menu with the exact same deliciousness. My only complaint is that this time of year (getting into winter) the way that the door is configured allows for a blast of cold air to blow in and hit the diners - who are all sitting at a long single table. It may not be their favorite for aesthetic, but a curtain in place would fix this problem and could be tucked away when the summer arrives.",
            "You know a place is popular when they open another location only a block away. Sadly, unlike the other location, this one doesn't have Luk Luka - a dish I've had before - of nicely seasoned cubed steak.\n\nLe Petit Cambodge was recommended to us by our Louvre Muse tour guide, Guillaume, who knew the hot spots for the locals. Unfortunately that meant it was also very popular and quite cramped. We had to share a table with another party.\n\nThe noodles with shrimp and beef was my favorite dish, but it was hard to mix in the small bowl provided. The lemongrass beef was also good. The chicken curry was dominated by tomato, which I didn't expect having had Cambodian food several times where I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. The curry was good but I expected it to be more curry-like.",

            "Excited to see the plant-based cuisine scene à Paris starting to grow!\n\nSense Eat is a lovely little eatery in the heart of the Marais. Perhaps the name suggests mindful eating. The ambiance is calming and simple yet sophisticated in a way that's refreshing for Paris. And the service is relaxed and cheerful. They seem comfortable serving American patrons.\n\nThe menu has many clearly marked vegan and gluten free options. We were brought a pleasant amuse bouche of a chilled fennel soup with a complimentary basket of rustic country bread (tasty!). We then started with the asparagus appetizer, which was perfectly cooked, as well as the sashimi, a bit of a misnomer as it turned out to be a flavorful savory flan over a crust of carmelized onion.\n\nFor the mains, we had the risotto, the bigoli pasta, and the sedano raoa. The sedano was baked and sautéed celeriac, with Ponzu sauce and a macadamia butter purée and of the dishes was the most innovative with a robust flavor profile. The other two dishes would be much better with salt and seasoning to bring forward the flavors.\n\nOverall, the concept is there and the mission is a brave one!",

            "I came here for dinner with a friend in December 2022 on the Wednesday before Christmas. We arrived around 7:15 PM without reservations and were able to be seated immediately. The restaurant, located near Opéra, was reasonably busy for a Wednesday evening and had a nice, comfortable atmosphere.\n\nMy friend ordered a green curry chicken and white rice, her usual go-to at a Thai restaurant, while I got a shrimp pad thai. It was a pretty rainy day in Paris so both of these were great comfort food dishes. My pad thai was good, a generous portion with a good amount of julienned vegetables mixed in and served at the perfect temperature. My friend found her curry to be a bit lukewarm when they first brought it out--maybe it had been sitting out while they were preparing my dish--but the server took it back to the kitchen and brought it out hotter. Other than that, my friend seemed to enjoy her curry.\n\nFor dessert we shared a mango sticky rice. I felt that the dessert here had a generous amount of sliced mango compared to other Thai restaurants I've frequented, which was nice. The sticky rice was also quite warm and soft, which is my preference. However, my friend tends to prefer mango sticky rice with a firmer/cooler rice part, so your mileage may vary.\n\nThe two mains and dessert, plus an appetizer of spring rolls, came to a total of just over 50€ total, which is pretty typical for a dinner out in Paris. Credit cards accepted (but not American Express). Overall, a solid place to get Thai food in the Opéra area!",
            "Knew I wanted Thai food but couldn't decide between dishes, so I ordered all three! Got spring rolls which were great! Still crunchy and delicious even after being delivered. Chicken satay was ok, nothing crazy but not bad. The chicken pad thai, however, was amazing! Perfect balance of sweetness and spice. Really really enjoyed. I would definitely order again, but would probably just skip the satay.",
            "Really good Thai food!! We have been looking for good Thai restaurant in Paris. Finally decided to come to try this one out. It turns out the food was amazing! Highly recommend their pad Thai and red curry. We just finished whole plates . Very glad we came.",
            "Worst Thai I ever ate In my life.\n\nOrdered spicy chicken pad Thai\nNo salt no spice in it\nThey gave me chill powder and asked me to mix it",
            "They actually served me a larb (minced meat salad) that was spicy enough to make me sweat! That is a win especially in Paris.\n\nWe were seated upstairs on a busy night so we were pretty much out of sight and out of mind but the food was very good."

I've been eating here quite regularly for lunch on weekdays, sometimes with my toddler in tow, and it has always been a wonderful experience. The menu changes daily depending on what organic vegetables have been delivered and I have always found the dishes to be thoughtful, tasty and well-prepared, with just the right touch of \"I'm eating out but it still feels like a home-cooked meal\". The service is friendly and the decor is very cute, unpretentious and rustic. I would recommend making a reservation but I've never had to wait without one if I got there early enough.\n\n- - -\n\nCela fait des annees que je ne publie plus d'avis sur Yelp, mais lorsque j'ai realise que la Cantine Vagabonde n'atteignait meme pas les 4 etoiles grace a des avis en manque d'inspiration et inutiles tels que celui d'Adrian M, j'ai decide qu'il etait temps d'agir! Je mange ici regulierement en semaine, parfois avec ma fille de deux ans, et a chaque fois mon dejeuner est fantastique. La carte change quotidiennement suivant l'arrivage des legumes et j'ai toujours trouve que les plats etaient bien penses, delicieux, prepares avec beaucoup d'attention et avec la juste dose de \"je mange a l'exterieur mais j'ai quand meme l'impression de manger du fait-maison\". Le service est sympa; le decor est mignon, sans pretention et rustique. Je dirais qu'il vaut mieux reserver mais je n'ai jamais eu a attendre en arrivant avant le rush.",
            "The Cantine is easy to find, near the Canal de l'Ourcq, just a block or two north of the Stalingrad metro station and a block or two south of the urban park Jardin d'Eole.\nThe chalkboard menu listed two vegetarian main courses, appetizer, dessert, wine, ginger beer , coffee and other non alcoholic beverages, all served in a homey ground-floor setting.\n\nThere are wooden tables inside, and a few cafe tables out front on the rue d'Aubervillers. The set meals are a good deal (a \"formule\" including appetizer, main & dessert, or other combos such as appetizer & main, or main & dessert ), the waitstaff is welcoming and the atmosphere is unpretentious .\n\nWe arrived shortly before lunch service ended, but were able to get a meal, though some some dishes were sold out. Our lentil salad and sweet potato felafel with mixed salad were tasty and fresh. We didn't feel pressured to order or eat quickly and were served promptly with a smile.\nSome staff are English speaking, if that's needed. Credit cards OK.",

First of all, you have to appreciate the humor/irony of seeing \"French toast\" on a Parisian menu. Then I saw it arrive on the table next to me and I was sold. However, the serving was huge. I asked the server and she was happy to make a half-order for me.\nThe bread is carmelized, not just toasted, and was unlike any French toast I'd ever had. My coffee took a little too long to arrive, but was quite good.\nThe restaurant is small but cheerful. The tables are small and close together. Fortunately, it wasn't too crowded when I was there, but I could see this being a bit of a madhouse at peak brunch hours.\nAll in all, this was a very solid choice and I found myself craving the French toast, so I returned for it a few days later.",

The cheesecake was delicious. The juice from the lime wedge really profiles the flavors. I would definitely return for a full meal."

            "We went there to eat in our way to Notre Damme. Althought it was a bit late for lunch in Paris (about 15 h) it was no problem.\nIt's true that the kitchen is a bit slow, but the service was express (but not much english speaking).\nWe went directly for the main course that was fine, a macrobiotic plate that I cannot recall its name. For dessert we took different sorts of apple cake (with nuts). As beverage we took an excellent carriot juice.\nAt about 45 € for 2 persons it was I bit pricey in my opinion.",
            "For the vegan traveller looking to take a walking break - what a gem!! This place has such heart, I absolutely adore it!! Flavours and quality of ingredients, with a fresh squeezed juice.. fantastic!! Definitely enjoying the light grocery shopping after. Probably taking home some granola :)\nThank you, thank you, thank you for this beautiful healthy place!! Home!",
            "A rip-off. I ordered a friut juice and a cereal vegetable item the size of a ping- pong ball (2.75 euros). The lady asked if I wanted some crudites with it. What she did not say was that a few strips of carrot cucumber abd red beets would increase the price of my ping- pong ball by 500 percent!\nI ended up having to pay 16 euros! Her comment? Oh , I forgot to show you the menu! I have seldom felt so cheated.",
            "This was the first meal we had in Paris and it was okay. We started out with the miso soup which was more like a Korean miso soup rather than the traditional Japanese version, more flavorful and with vegetables added instead of just tofu. I can't remember the name of what we had for our main dishes, but it was a plate of dips and steamed vegetables with a salad. The white bean dip and the olive paste were the only outstanding items. The service was a bit slow, but it was the kitchen, not the server's. You pay at the register at the front where you deal with the non-English speaking lady which was fine since I got by on enough high school French.",
            "Macrobiotic health food store and tea shop with a little cafe in the back. I am not sure if it was really vegan, as something tasted very like tempura fish. I know zero French, but they were still nice to me and I pointed at something I wanted on the pictureless menu. Got a macrobiotic plate with lentils, carrots and cabbage, couscous-like grain, and a bowl of what seemed like pumpkin tom kha - that was the best part. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I knew more about macrobiotic food; I was going in search of vegan fare since I have a dairy allergy. I also thought €17.50 was a little pricey."

            "The expansive but not too overwhelming menu, unforgettable flavors, and affordable price tag are all what now lands Tien Hang at the top of my favorite restaurants list. Yes - it's that good. So good, in fact, that we had to go a second time, just to make it the last meal we enjoyed in Paris.\n\nOur last visit, we just barely escaped the rain on our way but couldn't pass up watching the storm roll over at their open window seat. The space is on the smaller, intimate side but they have plenty of covered outdoor seating.\n\nTheir flavorful, steamed dumplings, warm noodle bowls [and service staff], fresh, chilled green tea, comforting coconut milk soup and sweet dessert buns not only filled us up to the brim, but left us craving even more.\n\nThe only thing I would've changed about my experiences at Tien Hiang would've been to have eaten there a third time. Who would've thought you could find an entirely plant-based gem this good in Paris, France?\n\n[x]: favorite dishes\n\nThe spreads [from 2 visits]:\n[x] STEAM MIX [dumplings] - 2 fun ko, 2 ha Tao, 2 bánh cuõn\n[x] \"BEEF\" or \"PRAWNS\" BÒ BÚN [bowls] - lemongrass \"beef\", news, fried tofu, rice vermicelli, Batavia salad, cucumbers, soy sprouts, peanuts, mint\nLEMONGRASS \"CHICKEN\"\nFRIED RICE - \"Ham\", tofu, carrots, peas\nCOCONUT MILK SOUP - \"prawns and chicken\", straw mushrooms, corn, tomatoes, coconut milk\nMOCHI - 2 pieces [matcha green tea, black sesame]\n[x] LOTUS BUNS - 2 pieces filled with lotus cream",

            "Of the two East Asian restaurants I went to in Paris (the other being Bodhi), I had a slight preference for this one. I ordered the satay noodle soup (€11), which came in a clay pot and was very rich and flavourful. I do wish there was more veggies in there. Fairly filling even if the portion was only moderate. Friendly service - they give you tap water without asking and don't charge (thank you). Recommended.",

            "Solid 3.5, but rounding up to 4 because it's better than average (and the cheese paratha bumped it up).\n\n100% vegetarian and Indian food. The pictures on the menu do not necessarily match up with the entree it is next to.\n\nAte palak paneer and butter paneer for dinner with side of parathas, and an extra cheese paratha. Palak paneer left much to be desired, was a little low on the flavor side. Butter paneer was much better, a little sweeter, and had a coconut flavor coming through. The plain parathas were thick and fluffy, great for sopping up sauces. The cheese paratha was really my star of the show- it was a kinda of Brie/cream cheese filling that was gooey on the inside. Somehow, it really brought extra flavor out in the entrees.\n\nWe arrived at an opportune time, so we didn't wait, but we were the last to arrive before the rush. After us, there was a constant wait and solo customers were seated in any available space, even with other guests. This did not impact us. The staff did not rush any of the guests to turn over tables and accommodate the rush.\n\nThe food seemed to be made upon request and the staff was constantly moving and serving.\n\nIn sum, if you are a vegetarian, looking for relatively cheap and tasty Indian food, don't mind a divey/crowded atmosphere, definitely check this place out- it clearly gets a lot of hype.",
            "Aapo: So, how are you doing?\n\nOsma: I'm good, pretty good.\n\nAapo: The subject of this interview is that Katja told me that you once made a sausage-bacon boat. Could you describe me what the sausage-bacon boat looks like and why would you do one?\nOsma: Unfortunately the case is that this is just a persistent rumour, I have actually never made a sausage-bacon boat. However, I did fabricate a cheese-bacon roll from braided bacons, in which you use two packets of bacon and braid them into a flat, square slab. Then you top that with a thick layer of shredded mozzarella, and in the middle you put blue cheese, which becomes the heart of the roll. Then you roll the whole thing up and stick it into the oven. Once it's golden crispy, you eat it like a thick swiss roll cake, only with meat.\nBut, you can find the instructions online for a sausage-bacon boat, or more accurately, a sausage-bacon pirate ship.\n\nAapo: Ok, but you never made one then. Can you tell me how does it look like?\n\nOsma: It has bacon sails and sausage masts.\n\nAapo: And what is the chassis of the boat made from?\n\nOsma: Minced meat.\n\nAapo: pfff kekekeke lol\n\nOsma: The sausage-bacon pirate ship comes from the same era as Epic Meal Time, if you remember them? They had this bro cooking show and became famous youtubers by putting Jack Daniel's and a lot of meat in everything they made.\n\nAapo: I'm not sure, were they the guys who were trying to make the most meaty things as possible. Like putting a chicken inside a pig inside a cow or something.\n\nOsma: Ah, you must be thinking of Turducken.\n\nAapo: What's that?\n\nOsma: It's chicken inside a duck inside a turkey, with minced pork meat layers in-between.\n\nAapo: Of course. What else could it be? Did you know that these things originate from medieval tradition of banquets that we're these long, extravagant dinners held by the lords that would include performances and several courses. And one of the things they would compete with was who would serve the most complicated food, and the dishes would be ridiculous. They would have bigger versions of Turducken, like starting from a cow and then a pig and then a turkey, and in the end it would be some tiny bird and maybe a small egg inside it. Some of them would have up to twenty layers.\n\nOsma: lol. Weren't swans a popular choice as well?\n\nAapo: Yeah they would put pluck a swan, put smaller birds inside it and cook it, and then re-attach each feather individually before serving it.\n\nOsma: Did you know that swans are like the bullies of the bird world? They pick on other smaller birds for no reason.\n\nAapo: Serves them right to be the center piece of a banquet then.\n\nAapo: What's the meatiest food you've ever eaten?\n\nOsma: My brothers friend Pasi had this recipe where he would wrap beef tenderloin inside minced meat.\n\nAapo: What? You mean a steak wrapped in minced meat?\n\nOsma: Yes it was kind of like beef wellington but he used minced meat instead of puff pastry.\n\nAapo: wtf hahaha\n\nOsma: ...what else...I have to admit that in my past life I used to eat pretty meaty things. When I was a teenager I had an habit to buy frozen pizzas and top them of with an entire packet of bacon and mountain of cheese. There would be so much bacon grease that it would basically deep fry the pizza. Pretty nasty. Like fried snickers level nasty.\n\nAapo: One of my friends in my hometown had a signature pizza in the local pizzeria which had five different meats, so basically everything they had. Salami, minced meat, kebab meat, pepperoni sausage and ham. And double cheese, of course.\n\nOsma: Goes without saying.\n\nOsma: I would say that in Portland I've eaten the most blatant things. It's the home base for both striptease and barbecue cultures.\n\nAapo: Portland! I thought it was THE hipster city when it was a thing?\n\nOsma: Yes. But it's also actually a really good culinary city, and it has most strip clubs per capita in the world. They have insane portions and all these food challenges. Like if you manage eat this 2,5 kg blob of meat you'll get it for free. Also the strip clubs serve food and the most fucked up thing is that people told me it's sometimes really good. I didn't try it though.\n\nAapo: Good to know, I guess. I had a meat overdose from a very traditional Finnish dish: the Iskender Kebab. Last time I ate one, which is years ago, I had the feeling that I really don't want to eat any meat for a week, or a month, or forever.\n\nOsma: Isn't it called \"meat sweat\" ?\n\nAapo: Hah, what's that? When you so much meat that you start to sweat?\n\nOsma: Exactly. But I guess it's a believable phenomena, won't meat put your body through quite a stress?\n\nAapo: For sure, and that kebab had at least triple effect.\n\nOsma: It's kinda fun to nostalgize eating meat, but I seriously feel much better when I don't eat meat.\n\nAapo: Yeah, I know what you're saying, I mean I do eat meat also but I'd say 90% of my diet is plant based or vegan. It just makes you feel so much better.",

            "The service from the beginning was rude. The waitress told us to hurry up and order. She had no patience and wouldn't answer our questions about the menu items. I won't be going back here. I expect polite service when I'm out spending my hard earned money. I do not recommend this place.\n\nThe food was terrible and very oily. This is not what authentic Indian food should taste like. The samosas seemed like they're either frozen or leftover from the day before. Masala dosa was cold by the time it reached my table; it even seemed a little under cooked. The paneer dishes had so much oil, it was ridiculous."

I got the falafel platter which came with fries, hummus, carrots, and a salad of beets & cabbage, and a couple pieces of their homemade pita bread.

This is one of those great unintentionally veggie places - they don't make a big show of being vegetarian, but incidentally I can have everything on the menu!

            "We were without a plan for dinner, wandering the streets of Paris looking for a place deserving to host us and our unhinged jaws when we stumbled upon this place.

Tina was sold because we had just downed a few cocktails and they had a bathroom.\n\nFortunately, we did not require a reservation for immediate seating on a Thursday night around 8ish.\n\nThey have an open concept kitchen so you can watch them do their thing and it is SO cool to see.\n\nThe staff were very friendly and really added to the experience.\n\nThe six course meal and wine pairing were both priced extremely reasonably. I would even go out on a limb to say that it's a very good deal.\n\nI don't remember specifics but I do both GF and I greatly enjoying our meal. The wines paired wonderfully with everything.

            "Every vegetarian in Paris needs to make this part of their agenda. Amazing experience for a family with meat eaters and vegetarians to share a great meal together. Awesome wine pairings and vibe. Great food and service from friendly staff.",
            "tl;dr: fantastic, complex, fun food. impeccable service, wildly fun experience.\n\nI came here with my girlfriend for dinner on our last night in Paris. We made a reservation two days prior and were lucky to snag one of the last tables at 9pm. When we arrived, I immediately noticed two seats at the chef's table (and two seats at a normal table across the room). As a gentle request, I pointed to the chef's table seats and asked the maitre d, \"is this for us?\" - I was ecstatic when he smiled and pulled out the chairs.\n\nAs soon as we were seated, we were seen by about 3 people - a nice woman who discussed wine options with my girlfriend while laughing, the maitre d who discussed the menu with us, and a bus boy who put down silverware and glasses of water. My girlfriend opted for a glass of wine and on the insistence of the waitress that she make us a free drink for \"waiting so long\" I received a glass of rose. My girlfriend enjoyed both.\n\nWe decided to split the veg tasting and normal tasting to maximize the number of dishes we tried. This ended up being a great decision, though the meat dishes usually outpaced the veg ones (sorry vegetarians).\n\nWe began with perhaps the most impressive and complex amuse-bouche I have ever tried. The veg was some small bite that tasted of corn but in a wildly delicious and simultaneously simple and complex way. It was served on a platter of raw corn kernels that I enjoyed watching my girlfriend mistakenly try to eat. The fish option was a mussel encased in a shiso leaf and tempura-fried. This was so delicious, I almost forgot to wonder how on earth they managed to keep the mussel encased during frying.\n\nThe next several dishes were a whirlwind of flavor, presentation, and culinary skill. On some occasions, I think they backed away from a risk taken in the last minute (the delicious smoked carrot that was pretty one-dimensional). On most occasions, the dishes balanced flavor, presentation, and fresh ingredients in ever-amazing ways.\n\nFor a few dishes, the head chef came over to us and discussed the ingredients and how they were prepared. This attention to the customers, ingredients, and preparation only served to make the dishes more delicious.\n\nThe desserts were all spot on. One managed to make my girlfriend revisit her hatred for caramels. All impressed.\n\nThroughout the meal, we had the pleasure of watching a team of 3 cooking their asses off in a minuscule kitchen. They managed to prepare a massive number of dishes without even a burner installed into the kitchen (they were using a small hot-plate that plugged into the wall and an open grill that was used for several dishes). Watching them work was almost as enjoyable as the meal. We were impressed with how the kitchen managed to communicate without talking and plate dishes in unison.\n\nAt the end of the meal, the chef visited us as the kitchen was shutting down. We told him how impressed we were with the food. I especially wanted to know how they managed to coordinate such complex dishes in such a small kitchen without talking barely at all. Apparently, despite this being their first month at the restaurant, the trio have been working together for several years and just migrated together from another restaurant. The chef is a very nice man who was funny and chatted with us briefly about his life and how much fun he is having cooking at Dessance instead of his previous occupation at a more traditional French restaurant.\n\nThe menu came out to about 70E/person with wine. I can't imagine there is a better combination of price, experience, and food in Paris. I hope they get a star in the next few years. They deserve it.",
            "Not only is the food delicious and beautifully plated, they are also serving some of the most interesting dishes I've ever had for a very reasonable price. For starters we tried 2 dishes. Sucrine, coriander tzatziki, poached pineapple, truffle vinaigrette. I don't even like coriander but the flavor was not over powering so I quite enjoyed it. This was basically a salad but it was plated carefully and that poached pineapple was like an explosion of flavor in my mouth. What I would give just to have a huge bowl just of this pineapple. The second starter was royale de foie gras, pickled cabbage, purple sweet potato crumble, braised fig. This is quite possibly the most interesting starter I've had in my entire life and it was plated so carefully. I can't describe to you how delicious that crumble was and all the ingredients complimented each other so well.\n\nFor the mains we had octopus, parsnip puree, spinach velouté, grilled almonds. A GORGEOUS dish that was more like a soup to me with octopus pieces on top. Again a great combination of ingredients like a match made in heaven. The star of the dish was really the spinach velouté and I wish they could just give me a giant thermos of it to go. The second main was a blanquette de veau, potatoes, carrots, endives, salted nuts. Tender, shredded veal with a delicious sauce and plated to look like a painting.\n\nI have been to some really good restaurants in Paris, but seriously none of them are as amazingly presented on the dish as Dessance. Every plate that comes to the table I am overjoyed with the care put into it. Also no other restaurant has such an interesting mix of ingredients together in one dish as well. I regret not having any desserts but I had several pastry shops I had to go after so I had to manage priorities!\n\nI don't really feel that pictures do this place justice. You have to come to experience it for yourself on your next trip to Paris. I know that on my next trip back I am 100% going to come back to Dessance again! Literally food art heaven"

For a family of four on a Monday evening, they were able to accommodate us. There are 4 restaurants in that row, but Saravanaa bhavan had most people with almost all tables filled. I also saw a lot of local people getting food here.\nThe ambiance is like a fast food style, but they provide table service. The staff is very friendly and communicates well in French, tamil, and English. You will feel you are in indian saravanaa bhavan here.\nWe ordered Thali meals, Chana bhatura, Ghee dosa, cauliflower 65, onion tomato uthapam, veg parotta, and veg biryani\nMy favorite was onion tomato uthapam. Nice consistency and tasted great. The least fav was veg biryani. The Chana curry tasted awesome. cauliflower 65 was perfect. The veg meals were perfect. They do provide refills for sides if needed on the meals.\nOverall, a great experience must try!!!",

            "I came here with a friend for dinner on a Tuesday evening in November 2019. Before moving to Paris, my friend had been a vegan, but found it tough to keep it up in France. It was nice to be able to go to a restaurant where she could be sure to find something vegan to eat. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived shortly after opening time that evening, but about an hour later it had filled up considerably.\n\nYou won't find \"traditional\" French food here, as the menu featured vegan takes on dishes such as tacos and Philly cheesesteaks. However, the food was pretty hearty and comforting, and it had clearly been prepared with care and health in mind. I ordered the tacos, which came as a trio, each with a different vegan filling (Impossible burger, sweet potatoes, and black beans). I wouldn't say it had the flavors/spice of Mexican food that I'm used to from the States, but it was tasty and filling. I also got a side of plantains, which was a very generous portion; I wound up not being able to finish them. My friend got the Philly \"cheesesteak\" with a side of fries and really enjoyed it.\n\nFor dessert, we got the cheese sampler, which came with some grain/seed crackers and a few grapes. The cheese sampler was probably more savory than we expected for dessert, so if you've got a sweet tooth I'd go for one of the other options. However, we really liked the \"cheeses,\" as they were all very flavorful and had a nice spreadable texture.\n\nThe restaurant was very cute and cozy. It's a small space, so the tables are pretty close together, but that's normal for a big city anyway. I really liked the décor, and the service was quick and friendly. The woman working at the restaurant spoke decent English, and there were English menus as well. I also felt the prices were pretty reasonable for Paris, and given the quantity and quality of the food.\n\nThe restaurant is conveniently located a short walk from the Paris Saint-Lazare train station. Definitely worth a visit if you'd like a nice vegan meal in a Parisian restaurant with a warm atmosphere.",
            "Yem'a is for real folk. Working folk. Anyone who wants to fill their belly without entirely emptying their pockets. Hacina takes pride in providing dishes that are hearty, wholesome, and, above all, accessible. No 20 euro rice balls here -- you're going to leave nourished and satisfied.\n\nSee, unlike some vegan restaurants, Yem'a is anything but pretentious. Cantine-style and communal, you bus your own table, and sit real-cozy-like next to your neighbor in the small eating area in the back of the restaurant.\n\nAnd guess what?\n\nIt's gluten-free, too. So suddenly planning next week's luncheon with your work team just got that much easier. (Because we know your project manager Gustave has celiac something fierce.)\n\nThe carrot and raisin curry is A-MAZ-ing, as is the quinoa tagine, the lentil purée, and heck, everything really. (Make sure you try the chick pea bake!)",
            "Let's get to the important things first: counter service, almost no tables to sit so plan for takeout, and plan to get their early before lunch gets going because they had a line out the door. You can pick your plate with 2-4 entrees from the mini-deli of fresh vegan offerings. You can finish your meal with specialty drinks and vegan desserts. Half my food was pretty flavorful, the other half fairly bland... all of it was fresh. Pricing is reasonable. I'd go again. Beware... don't fall down the stairs that are just inside the entrance. They need a baby safety gate lol",
            "Me and my two kiddos came here today. The service is phenomenal and the food is delicious! My daughter asked for a second plate. They have amazing juices and desserts as well. Highly recommend!"

            "A very local little spot just down from our hotel. Wonderful, wonderful evening. I had a grilled salmon that was perfectly prepared, along with a wonderful presentation of fresh broccoli and carrots with some small cooked potatoes. Served nice and hot, everything was perfect. There was one other english speaking couple in the restaurant everyone else certainly sounded local.\nOne aside--I noticed that at the both the pubs in England and the restaurants in France that there is no background muzak.

            "A good restaurant in a good location. I found this place looking for restaurants near Moulin Rouge and it did not disappoint.\nThe owners were friendly and speak some English if needed. We were greeted by them at the door. There was no one inside during our whole meal around 8:00, but surrounded by a relaxing and intimate atmosphere.\nThe menu has a lot to choose from, even a vegetarian plate (which I of course went for, and it was delicious with so much variety). They also have a big drink and dessert selection.\nMy only complaint is that they do not accept credit cards. So be sure to have cash on you if you go.\nIf you are in the montemarte area, this is a nice place to dine for a more elegant meal.",
            "L'Homme Tranquille is a great example of the essential French bistro experience. No sprawling menu or ostentatious cocktail collection. Just great food and a well-curated wine list.\n\nMy girlfriend went with the steak and I had the vegetarian option which was lentils, couscous, potatoes, mushrooms and a green salad. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare. French bistros are certainly not known for their vegetarian/vegan options but I was totally blown away by my meal.\n\nCan't say enough about the service as a single server was not only handling an entire restaurant but she was singlehandedly providing better service than most restaurant's entire staff. The cosy atmosphere and a perfect red wine recommedation made for an incredibly memorable Parisian dining experience.",
            "If you're seeking an authentic French cuisine experience this is a wonderful place to go. During a recent trip to Montmartre I ate here for dinner three times! The cooking is all totally homemade and fresh. My favorite waiter is Édouard, he is very gracious and an excellent host. Be sure to order the plat du jour, no matter what it is you won't be disappointed.",

We got goat cheese salad with berry jam; beef with red wine and blue cheese sauces, duck layered with potatoes, rice pudding with caramel sauce and espressos. It was so nice to sit, enjoy our meal, and enjoy a locals favorite. Highly, highly recommend."

We ordered both fish and vegetarian entrees, soups and salads. Everything was fresh and tasty, generously portioned and well presented. After our meal we were expecting to be rushed out since it was now an hour after the posted closing time but instead were offered desserts and we were happy to accept.

            "We were really excited to try this vegetarian restaurant but were quite disappointed. First of all they did not check any ones vaccine QR codes. People were jammed in there so tightly with no windows or doors open even though it was really hot inside.\n\nI ordered a juice which was fine and the pumpkin soup. I don't mind plain things. But this soup was unedible it was like they just puréed pumpkin and that's it. I try adding salt but it didn't help I just left it on the table. My husband's food was nothing exciting either the staff would wear their mask and then take them off and then put them on again. I would not recommend this place at this time",
            "We got there and no one checked out health pass. So crowdedness stuffy. No windows were open and it was so hot with no circulation. The staff were wearing masks on and off\n\nOrdered pumpkin soup which was SO bland I could hardly eat it. We weren't given water once. Do not recommend.",
            "I wish I could give a higher rating to support a vegetarian restaurant, but the food is just not very good. It's the kind of boiled vegetables, cereal and salad you could do at home by yourself, were you not so lazy. Luckily there is a ton of condiments on the table, so, after drenching my food in soy sauce, oil and vinegar, the dish acquired a bit of flavour.\nDespite the simplicity of the preparation, the service was extremely slow (we waited at least 45 minutes for our dish) so not a good option if your lunch break is short.",
            "Such pleasant service and wonderful food. It's quaint, and contains a rustic, French feel that made this tourist and her husband feel like we were getting beyond the touristy experience. Our wonderful, young waiter tried his best to speak English with us as he saw our French was lacking. We had a few laughs trying to communicate with one another, but he was never snobby or frustrated with us. They also had a small array of vegan items for sale, which was great for me as I was able to pick up a few items for my journey. It's also in walking distance of many site seeing opportunities."

I opted for take out of a vegan bacon cheese burger with fries and a drink for €11.\n\nThe burger was average in size and the cheese was really great. I loved it. Even though I opted for takeout, the fries were still crispy by the time I got to my hotel. The burger though, wasn't a fake meat patty, like I might expect in some American burger joints. This burger was more mushy. Not my thing, I like a fake meat burger. The taste was great though, so I do recommend it.\n\nI'd definitely come back again and try some of the other vegan options, like hot dogs or cakes. Recommended!",
            "Small fast food joint with many vegan options for burgers and hot dogs. The bun is amazing! Combo for burger,fries and drink is 12 euros. Fries were absolutely delicious, crispy on the outside and soft pillowy on the inside. They have a handful of vegan dessert which we tried the peanut butter cheesecake and banana chocolate tart. Delicious!! Elated that Paris has vegan options and extremely tasty ones nonetheless! Service is very friendly, cashier obviously caught on we were American and offered an English menu. Fast, delicious, very affordable vegan burgers and desserts. Please keep supporting vegan businesses!!",
            "Came here the other day with some friends. I don't eat meat besides chicken so a friend had found this place. I was really excited to try. The burgers were €7 and if you got the meal i believe it was €11 or €12 that included fries and a drink. I had just ate so I opted for just a burger. I ordered the Le Basque (comes with a patty of choice, lettuce, cheddar cheese, caramelized red peppers) I ordered it with a setan* patty.\n\n*if you've never tried satan before its 100% gluten and its really hard for your body to digest*\n\nI wasn't crazy about the burger, the cheese seemed to be like fake american cheese in plastic sheets. And I would have prefered carmelized onions over red peppers. But within a few hours I got very sick to my stomach. Luckily with some research, it turned out to be from the setan. Which has nothing to do with the restaurant but just how my body reacted to it. What I'd love to see is a veggie burger thats made with vegetables and not tofu and setan.\n\nMenu looked very good, especially the appetizers. Would deffinitly come back to try other items!",
            "We popped in here around lunch time while on vacation. I really wanted to try this place, it was on my to do list. It was great! We shared the Marcello and the East Side with fries. Both were so tasty, I am always on the hunt for the best veg burgers and this place has got them! Don't forget to try the homemade coleslaw and there is also a great selection of desserts.\nBonus, it's right next to the metro Saint Ambroise.",
            "Having failed to get into Deux Fois Plus de Piment (on a Friday night, of course this would happen without a reservation), we wandered back past the Boudin Noir on offer at Diablito Latino and decided to see what a vegan burger is at East Side Burgers.\n\nWith a variety of choices, I opted to try the vegan bacon with cheeseburger. It was... uh...: relatively small (which is good); the patty tasted vaguely of beans, the cheese of cheese, and the bacon was an amusing colour but didn't taste of much. Not sure what could have made it taste better; it was a fair imitation of a fast-food burger but... I wouldn't be rushing back to try their other burgers though.\n\nI would have liked to try their homemade coleslaw (I love a good coleslaw) but they were sold out. The fries were awesome though; very crisp and with an addictive quality about them. Nom nom.\n\nPoints for contributing to a healthier planet, and in a hipster atmosphere (the outside table looked nice, the posters on the walls were fun)... The burger was two stars, but the fries and ambience bring this review up to three."

Would I order it again? No, but worth trying once. We got the burger and broccoli pie for our mains. The burger was decent but the pie was tastelessand quite mush.

            "As a vegan I was looking for something, anything, besides avocado toast, a salad or pasta with plain tomato sauce in Paris! My daughter found Veget Halles, which was a ten minute walk from our hotel near the Louvre. The narrow street is sits on felt a bit sketchy but it was perfectly safe. Aside from a terribly long wait for our entrees to arrive after our appetizers (everyone around us was served before us, which made us wonder if our order was forgotten- seriously it took almost a hour!) the food was very good. We had two orders of curry rolls for an appetizer. Yum! My omnivore daughter had the pesto pasta (she gave me the two pieces of seitan chicken on top), my pescatarian daughter has the curry (she loved it), and I had the burger. It was such a nice mixture of flavors and textures. Only two people were working to cover the busy restaurant, and I think one was the chef herself. Because of the slow service I'm giving them 4 stars. The vegan oasis in Paris was five stars.",
            "Ok. I like what they're doing here, I love the variety of options on the menu, the incredible pricing for a 3-course lunch, the service and the ambience. Overall, I'd give it 3.5 stars. That being said, all of the flavors were just a bit off, a bit lacking. The butternut squash tart was very mild, not savory, not sweet. It needed salt and some aromatics, maybe some green onion to liven it up. The brown rice was just rice. The lentils were the best part and had subtle depth of flavor. The dessert was similar.. chocolat creme...not sweet enough to the point it almost didn't taste like dessert. Otherwise creamy with nice texture.",
            "Before heading into the Louvre, we had a tasty lunch at a vegetarian restaurant called Végét'Halles. We shared the Beignet de tofu avec sa Vegannaise (Tofu fritters with vegan mayonnaise) and a Burger Végét'halles with frites! We also spent a fair amount of time fighting over the water and whether we were going to be charged for it. The short answer was yes, so maybe we shouldn't have asked for any.",
            "I am totally loving the fact there are so many vegetarian choices these days in Paris - maybe I never looked in the right places or maybe new places continue to open but whatever the case, Saveurs Végét'Halles was a delicious choice for our first evening's meal\n\nWe'd asked a Conceirge to help us identify somewhere walkable & veggie & he directed us here & even called ahead to secure reservations - you'll want to do the same as they were fully booked for the evening!!\n\nOrdered the mushroom pate to start & it was extremely flavorful & savory - paired with onion jam & baguette - this was so delish!\n\nMain dishes included the Spinach & Chevre Tart for the Mr - there was an abundance of spinach & I am not a fan so I didn't even taste it but the Mr said it was hearty & the chevre offered that extra flavor layer to make it even better\n\nI chose the Mushroom Loaf with a fruit reduction sauce ( I think it was blackberry? ) and assorted veggie sides like wild rice, warmed lettuce & carrots, and lentils. This was SO GOOD! Just like a meatloaf and thoroughly delish! The Mr said while he liked his dish, the mushroom loaf was better\n\nWe also noticed lots & lots of people ordering their Veggie Burger - made us want to come back & indulge - and we have plans to do just that on our next visit!\n\nDesserts included the Apple Crumble & their Sesame Tiramisu & we split these - the tiramisu was very light & whipped like a mousse & had that slight peanut buttery taste - incredible! The apple crumble was hearty & loved the thick & crumbly crust - both winners!\n\nPaired it all with a delish Brouilly & we enjoyed a wonderful welcome to the City of Lights."

I went to this restaurant with two others, and after struggling with a finicky QR code, we ordered. We ended up waiting for about half an hour. The food was unacceptable. The asparagus rigatoni was virtually inedible, lacked any taste at all, and was boiled to a soft mush. Everything desperately needed salt and pepper, and my party mostly ended up picking at the baguette meant to accompany the ramekin mashed potato dish. I would pay not to eat here. Go to the gelato place across the street, lots of sorbet!!!",

It also had shiitake mushrooms in a saté sauce, marinated tofu, kobacha squash, plantains, and fresh greens. I definitely enjoyed every single bite.\n\nThe small bowl was perfect for a light lunch.

The tofu was completely bland and basically just boiled, while the beets and lemon sauce were incredibly strong - to the point that they were inedible to me.\n\nWe also got a pita sandwich with seitan and vegetables. It was one of the blandest sandwiches I've ever tasted in my life - there were no spices, seasonings, or sauces.\n\nFinally, we got a chia pudding and a rice pudding. They were both extremely bland and unenjoyable.\n\nWhile it was at first exciting to find a veg restaurant in Paris, I would most definitely not be back.",

Super tasty and filling, a large bowl with juice is 14euros. Everything is fresh and delicious and there was quite the lunch crowd. The ambiance of the cafe is cozy, adorable and filled with natural light and plants that makes it enjoyable to dine in. Food was prepared quickly, the only downside is that the cashier had limited English. Not a problem since everything looked amazing and I'm sure we could do no wrong ordering anything on the menu.

            "I love burgers. My go to meal: burger. This place? An overly priced burger joint that is filthy with oily and burnt mediocre burgers.\n\nI saw a cockroach crawl across the floor before my food came out. How appetizing. The dark atmosphere combined with the dirty utensils and critters ruined any appetite I had.\n\nI ordered my burger patty pink, and it came out burnt lifeless topped with grease. I shared the bacon fries which were also nostalgically oily with no flavor.\n\nOnly pro. Service was nice, but slow like all French restaurants\n\nIf you're craving burgers, go to McDonalds instead. If you're craving a cockroach, come here.",
            "Ate here withy family, and we all loved it. Highly recommend the Loaded Fries. We ordered the burgers well done because we were worried about them being too pink, but medium would have been better. Warning their secret sauce is mustard-based (which my daughter didn't like too much) but the rest of us liked it. Service was fast and very friendly. Highly recommend this place to scratch that itch for a great burger while in Paris!",
            "Ok, so, during a recent 10-country jaunt through Europe, I ate a ton of burgers. Like, an embarrassingly-high number of burgers that would definitely classify me as your typical American buffoon tourist. I mean, who the heck eats a hamburger every other day when they're traveling through countries that offer some of the world's most wonderful cuisines?\n\nThe silver lining of this, however, is that this makes me the de facto expert on European hamburgers right? Therefore, I can confidently say that PNY provided me the best-tasting burger during my three-month foray into eating your continent's fine offering of hamburgers.\n\nI think that must be attributed to the quality of the beef this restaurant sources. Do their cows have a glass of Burgandy wine each night before bed? Maybe the cows eat baguettes with roquefort and jambon each morning for breakfast. I'll never know, but I do know the burgers here are pretty damn tasty.",
            "My husband and I had a great lunch here today! I really love the vibe of this place. We are total foodies and love a good juicy burger.\n\nThey have a prix-fixe meal for €15 that includes a sandwich, fries or salad and a beverage. I had the burger with blue cheese, bacon and grilled onions, he had the fish sandwich. My burger was cooked exactly as I ordered it and was delicious. The service was friendly and fast. The wine was great, my husband liked his beer and I enjoyed the lemonade which is really lemony and not to sweet.\n\nAmericans: Please note... You can't judge the service of a restaurant in France based on how things work at home. The culture is different here and what you may perceive as rude or indifferent is not the case at all. Slow down and acclimate! Different isn't bad... It's just different. It may not be the restaurant that needs to change... It may be your expectations.\n\nI keep seeing reviews from US based travelers bashing French establishments when really, it's the travelers who haven't taken the time to get to know the culture and understand how things work here. It's frustrating and makes us all look bad! This comes from the perspective of a total foodie who eats out 4-5x/week, knows great food and cooks great food.\n\nParis New York place is definitely worth a visit and we'll definitely be back. Thank you PNY for a delicious, relaxing and delightful lunch!"

            "I tried this restaurant while on vacation. As an American, I refrain from getting burgers while traveling abroad because I assume nobody can make a burger like the US--but this place proved me wrong. The vintage burger is possibly the best cheeseburger I have ever had! The service was also great, as our waiter explained to us what each burger included and led us to discovering what we actually wanted to order. I almost didn't order the loaded fries due to some negative reviews on here talking about weird cheese, but I am SO glad I did. They were literally amazing and I highly suggest ordering them. This place also has a great vibe and is surrounded by cute stores. 10/10! Will definitely be returning the next time I am in Paris!",
            "Paris New York is a hip burger chain with eight locations across Paris and several more in different parts of France. We went to the PNY in the Marais during a long weekend in Paris, and it was nice to break up all the French food we were eating with a casual Yankee dinner.\n\nMy friends and I dropped in for a late dinner, at 10:00 on a Saturday night. The place wasn't busy, but it felt pretty lively, with a fun, trendy vibe. We got a table upstairs in an attractive dining area cheerfully decked out in green and pink.\n\nService was friendly, if not especially attentive. Our waiter switched my order with my friend's, and we only figured it out when we were halfway done with our burgers. I guess the clues were there--my burger wasn't medium rare and I was missing the jalapeños I ordered, while my friend thought her burger was weirdly spicy. I did at least get an extra side of the jalapeños when I pointed out their absence.\n\nI enjoyed my dinner, though, even with the wrong burger. I ordered the Golden but got the Big Mac Tribute instead, and this was very good, flavorful and juicy, despite being cooked medium well. We all shared fries and these were delicious, as were the jalapeños. I washed down my meal with a draft beer, either the Deck & Donohue Pils or IPA--I don't remember which, but I do know it hit the spot.\n\nI love a good beer and burger spot, and I imagine I'd be dependent on PNY if I lived in Paris. I'd recommend it if you're craving some hearty American fare.",
            "PNY earns a solid 4 stars for providing English-speaking service in Paris, a rarity in many establishments. Being able to place an order and feel somewhat at home thanks to their kind service is a definite plus.\n\nWhile the food may have been just okay and the menu simple, the atmosphere is what truly stood out. The hip hop music playing in the background, especially with some throwback hits, added a unique touch to the dining experience.\n\nA special shoutout to the gentleman whose name you didn't catch but who provided great service and answered all your questions. His attentiveness undoubtedly enhanced your visit to PNY, making it a memorable stop in Paris.",
            "High hopes for you PNY....but you let me down..\n\nService is key in my book. So having the opportunity to provide optimum service shouldn't be hard. Not only is it an obligation its also a privilege to serve burgers. Reminder, It's burgers!! Bring your A GAME!\n\nFinally foods here, now on to the burgers. As you see the Patty to bun ratio just doesn't add up. This is why I have trust issues. I repeat ratio was off!\n\nNext flavors, no where near what you would want in a burger. I had 2 other burger experiences in Paris and all I gotta say is why isn't everyone else like them. But here are at PNY.\n\nThe bacon is extremely off putting. If you're a bacon fan this isn't for you. It's soft, and gamey. Seems like the chef was scared to cook it and so I was scared to eat it. Then the cheese on the loaded fries, let me be clear;that ain't no cheddar. I know what cheddar is and that was not it. Try refrigerating your cheddar, whatever was used used was way to pungent to be on something called loaded fries next to a burger.\n\nBest for last, the Big Mac tribute was far off my friends. FAR OFF. You guys had one job, make Big Mac sauce, and you failed. No middle bun, and no sesame bun. Fail. 86.\n\nAll in all 8 total guests and only one raving about the mushroom burger. Just wish this place lived up to my expectations.",
            "Okay seriously? Who thinks of coming to Paris for the best burgers and fries ever? I honestly think the chicken tenders here are better than any I have ever had in the USA!!! They were crunchy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside, and so delicious! My husband couldn't believe how spicy the Bangkok Burger was - it comes with jalapeños and Sriracha- he loved it. And the kids gobbled up every bite of their Children's menus with a small burger, fries, and a homemade soda. They also shared an Oreo milkshake for dessert. Service was excellent. We loved it!"

            "!!! ATTENTION : FREEGAN PONY IS CURRENTLY CLOSED !!! Yesterday, A group of friends and I went out of our way to visit the venue after planning a week in advance. There were discrepancies with the opening times between what was listed on Facebook and on the webpage, so opted for an 20:00 arrival time. All signs pointed to the venue being open. However, it was closed without any notice. We later found out that due to internal management issues and licensing shortfalls they shut down (or were shut down by authorities).\n\nTHE VERDICT : GIVE NOTICE to eliminate confusion and disappointment. I am surprised that no one else has bothered to mention anything, manager or visitor alike. Given the ratings, there was something special going on there - an opportunity to set an example and integrate itself into the fabrics of the community...\n\nWhatever is going on, I hope that the leaders find strength in another like-minded initiative and approach it with a greater sense of responsibility.\n\nBest,\ne",
            "Hands down - this is the coolest and hippest spot in Paris at the moment.\nWhat is Freegan pony? Tucked away at the edge of Paris, you'll find this gem in the most improbable spot. The vibe here is definitely very underground and you really must come see for yourself to experience it.\nFreegan, a hybrid word combining \"free\" and \"vegan\", is just that. Here, volunteers salvage the leftovers from Paris' largest fruit and veggie market (Rungis) and then scramble to cook up a delicious meal with that. The menu obviously changes every day depending on what's left over, and that's the cool part. It's all vegetarian - no meat - and sometimes some grain or bread will be added to accompany your meal and give it consistency. When I was here, we had a delicious tomato soup as a starter, then a dish with couscous type grains and tomato and fried onions with a white sauce, followed by rice pudding for dessert.\nOnce you open the door to this underground lair, you first sign up at a small table and are explained the concept, as well as given a membership card to the association. Reservations are an absolute MUST btw, as it is very popular and also seats and feeds a max of 50. (Also you need to reserve in order to know when it's open - currently it's open Friday - Monday but that could change.)\nThen you go to the counter and grab a cup, plate, napkin, and silverware and seat yourself. All the tables, furniture, decoration, silverware, etc is all second hand and gives it a really vintage feel. It's really an experience eating here.\nBtw: It can be a bit nippy in here, so make sure to bring an extra sweater and dress warmly!\nYou then wait for the kitchen staff to call your name. One of the members of the association came over and explained the concept and the evening's menu to us, letting us know that they had put a lot of love into sorting through all the Rotten tomatoes and salvaging what they could. It was cool to have that kind of interaction with the association members/volunteers and give it a more personalized feel. I'm sure it's not an easy task concocting menus and cooking for 50!\nAt the end, when you've finished eating, you must clear away your dirty dishes and leave them in a designated area, which will have been explained and shown to you upon entry (just like at the cafeteria).\nAt the end, it's up to you to choose how much to pay. There is no set price, and you choose to give the amount you want. It really makes it accessible to everyone.\nTo sum up : if you haven't been here yet, seriously what are you waiting for? This place is AWESOME. Can't wait to come back!\nP.S.: Don't forget to make reservations!"

I wanted to visit this shop for the tea and yarn, but I admit I was disappointed to find very little yarn. The website and photos describe the shop to have more choices and yarn appeal, perhaps I was there between inventory changes.\nThe staff was friendly and accommodating. They brought a little water bowl for our little dog, which was very kind of them to do.",

            "Okay I've officially entered \"hibernation mode\" in Paris. I know it's only October but for a Texan, this feels like the icy depths of hell and I want to bury under the covers and not come up until April. Seeing as how that's not an option, I decided I can at least have a happy medium by holing up in cozy cafes for hours with good friends and hot drinks. Enter L'Oisivethe.\n\nA delicious combination of tea house and knitting store, this place screams \"I am girlie and I like tea caddies and kittens and reading fashion magazines and knitting hats for my dad.\" I knew places like this existed in Portland, Oregon, but I didn't expect them in Paris. I'm not sure the whole \"hipster knitting\" has caught on here. Nevertheless, it is alive and well near the Place d'Italie metro. The neighborhood was filled with cute shops and restaurants, but the tea shop is my favorite. Not only do they serve a fixed price brunch on weekends, but they appeared to have a daily special going as well: 5.50 for a tiny coffee, your choice of cookie/pain d'epice/citrus cake, some fruit, and a teeny bowl of spiced ice cream--make that 7.50 for a pot of tea.\n\nAnd the tea options are overwhelming. In fact I was so overwhelmed I got the coffee. Lame, I know. But I'll be back. Seeing as how the place is quite small, I would show up at an \"off\" time, as it was absolutely packed on a Saturday night, and god knows I wasn't going to sit outside. Plus, they close early--around 7pm.\n\nBring your best girlfriend or mum when it's absolutely nasty outside. My only complaint: no comfy, squashy armchairs to lounge in and knit for hours....",
            "The sweetest lil place, and the waitress is a doll! Yarn, tea, comfort cozy place that is a wonder for worn travelers like me. That caramel rooibos revived me. The walls are filled with yarn, and the place is filled with sweet elderly neighborhood folks, toddlers and family. Highly recommend it!",
            "This is a magical place! They specialize in yarn from the U.S. And Canada, but very good quality. The women here are delightful and passionate about knitting, I highly recommend!"

The vegan beef was delicious although the portion was much smaller than the equivalent item on the other set menu, which was my ma po tofu (not at all numbing spicy but still tasty in a sour-sweet way). The noodles and papaya salad were very good (but not as good as at Tien Hiang). The accompanying seaweed tofu soup was excellent down to the very last drop. The fried banana and lychee desserts were delicious.\n\nVery comfortable and pleasant ambiance. Service was excellent.",
            "As vegetarians, we are always excited to find and try all-vegan or vegetarian restaurants. This one was an especially good one because the pan-Asian food we had here was very flavorful and a change in taste from other meals we had that week while we were in Paris. We had the pan-fried dumplings (pretty good), tofu skewers (twice--so good we ordered again), black pepper hot pot (yummy!), and mapo tofu (could have been spicier, but still good) with sticky rice. In retrospect it was a lot of tofu that we ordered and we would have liked to try a noodle or curry dish, but we were already so full after these plates!

The flavor comes from fleur d'orange syrup, which was cool to discover. I also got the black gnocchi (interesting, but not my favorite of the night) and the salmon gravlax (this was the super star!!). The salmon was prepared like a delicious ceviche with lots of meat--yum. They also provided a little soup-like aperitif, which was quite interesting and unique.\n\nOverall, I really loved the atmosphere, originality of the menu, and of course the taste.

            "Before arriving in Paris, I searched for restaurants and cafes that focused on healthy meals. Paris is known for its food, especially the country's traditional cuisine, and we all know it's fairly decadent. I wanted to limit these types of meals.\n\nOne of the places I discovered was Supernature. It's located in the 2nd Arrondissement, which is the garment district -- if you're interested in checking out this area.\n\nI loved the ambiance here. It's fresh and clean and filled with houseplants.\n\nA guy sat at the two-top next to me, and it turns out he's an expat from Chicago. He said that he ate at Supernature almost daily. If that alone isn't an endorsement then I don't know what is.\n\nEverything on their menus is organic and fresh. Their fais maison boeuf France is farm-raised beef in France.\n\nNot having had mollusks in a while, I ordered the moules farcies à l'arménienne, Armenian stuffed mussels, featuring tomatoes, saffron, and parsley. A salad of fresh green peas, cabbage, kale, and radishes came with the meal. All of it was delicious, and the mussels are considered a superfood.

( I've been around the world ) it was so juicy and crispy at the same time.. so good I didn't have the chance to try the rest of the menu but this place seems very legit to eat in.\nFood portions are very healthy.\nThey also have press juice.\nDef will be back",
            "Apart from the juices and the fact they accept bookings, nothing good to report. One star because I would never come back.\n\nThis is another super healthy place with a menu which sounds so appetizing you'll struggle to choose but all dishes I tasted were disappointing. I tasted several dishes (put aside 17 euros for a main) and all were terrible. My quinoa salad was hugely under seasoned and the fresh produce used wasn't ripe enough (or poor quality) to the point where I couldn't finish (I'm a finisher normally) I tried some baked fish with sweet potato fries too which were dry and moist respectively, when it really should have been the other way around.\n\nService relatively friendly, if a little slow. If you're seeking something healthy and light for lunch, there are plenty of other places in the area. Id recommend Mûre, Mongoo or Chemin Vert over this place any day.\n\nShame because I had heard good things.",
            "My family and I had an early Friday dinner and were excited to try a new spot. The meal seemed healthy but delicious. The tuna, mussels and meatballs were our favorites.\n\nWe speak very little French, but the staff was willing to help and describe the menu with us - which was appreciated!\n\nThe lighting is a bit harsh for a cozy looking spot - but overall very enjoyable experience.",
            "A hamburger that actually makes you feel healthy while eating it? Yes, yes yes -- the unimaginable is possible at the aptly named Supernature!!\n\nThis small, organic restaurant keeps its carnivores happy with one of the best burgers in the city. Served on a slightly toasted bricohe bun with cheddar, sprouts and a delicious creamy sauce on top, alongside dry roasted potatoes and a fresh green salad, their cheeseburger plate checked all of my burger boxes.\n\nThis small resto with sun-drenched terrace is a hotspot at lunch, so you need to be patient or come at an off-hour for a quick table and service."

            "This was my favorite meal in Paris. I usually eat vegan food at home so this meal was the only time I had food I am used to eating. French food is pretty rich and heavy as most people know. We were the only people there so like another review mentioned, do not let that chase you away! We weren't even sure they were open, but we were glad we opened the door! It was the quietest place we ate in Paris and probably all of France!",
            "I'm a vegan but when I travel to countries where I'm horrible with the language, I typically go vegetarian to make life easier. However, after two days of heavy foods, I couldn't take it anymore and began to research vegan restaurants. I was so excited to find this place - the soup and dumplings I had were my absolute favorite foods of the entire trip. The restaurant is small and the lovely waitress/cashier/food runner, is also the chef (!!) so be prepared for a small wait. However, it is totally worth it! If you are strictly vegan, you will need to ask which items are vegan as they're not indicated on the menu, but it appeared to me that a large majority of the items are vegan. I truly can't say enough about this place and the our server/chef (she's so sweet and absolutely KILLS it in the kitchen). Next time I'm in Paris, I'm going to eat here every day :)",
            "What a great find for us on our last night in Paris! After a long week of travel in Paris and elsewhere, we were looking for a nice, low key vegetarian restaurant. After some Yelp'ing and Google'ing, we happened upon this spot. It being France, we needed to wait until 7 PM for it to open, but after a quick beer at a nearby pub we were good to go. From the very start, we had a great experience. We got great tips from the host and readily landed on great starter and main dish selections. Needless to say, we were not disappointed by anything that we ordered. We truly enjoyed our meal - all dishes were well perpared and very tasty, really liked the quaint, small size of the place, and the price was also right. For certain, we will gladly return here again, and would recommend it for anyone looking for a nice, vegan/vegetarian spot - whether you are familiar with Tibetan food, or not. You can't miss at Restaurant du Tibet-Pemathang. Thanks for a wonderful evening!",
            "First let me say that Pema Thang is not an Asian Fusion restaurant: it is a Tibetan restaurant that offers only vegetarian/vegan fare. I'm a vegetarian and have traveled to Paris several times per year for business. I stay for about a week in the Latin Quarter on each visit and patronize Pema Thang at least once during each visit. As a vegetarian, I consider France a food desert. In the typical French restaurant, the vegetarian options on lunch/dinner menus are non-existent. They'll usually whip up an omelette on special request, but one can only eat so many omelettes. I have tried most of the better known vegetarian restaurants in central Paris, but a desire for more variety caused me to seek out other options, and that's how I discovered Pema Thang. The restaurant offered some meat dishes until about 2 years ago, but has gone vegetarian/vegan since then. I'm not sure about the vegan qualification because I eat dairy and eggs.\n\nThe restaurant is adjacent to a larger, better publicized Tibetan restaurant. Pema Thang is quite small, less than 10 tables on the main floor, and has an intimate and authentic-feeling Tibetan decor. Each time I've been there, I've been hosted and served by the same charming Tibetan woman. She told me that many of the guests are regulars, coming every one-to-two weeks. The restaurant's phone number was changed recently, costing them some business. Because of its size, this restaurant is best for parties of four or less. Don't be put off if there are only one or two other parties dining there.\n\nThe menu has about 10 starter options, three groups of main courses, and desserts. On my most recent visit I tried the 4-course menu for 19.50 Euros. It started with a delicious spinach and grain soup -- a fresh spinach taste came through clearly. The main course consisted of 8 steamed dumplings stuffed with tempeh (I think) accompanied by a salad of shredded carrots and glass noodles with a subtle dressing. The meal included a choice of desserts (I had rice pudding) and a pot of tea (I had butter tea). I was quite hungry and thought the quantity might not be sufficient, but I felt quite filled afterward. I would rate the spicing as very mild with a few marked dishes being a little spicier, toward medium, but definitely nothing really hot.\n\nI've never been disappointed here after quite a few visits. I've given this restaurant a five partly because any restaurant that offers truly healthy, vegetarian fare in France is to be applauded. But the service, atmosphere, and tasty food all work together to make this a really good choice and a good value."

            "Someone suggested this place to me after I asked for something nearby that was quick, light (not-too-heavy) and affordable. This place is all of the above and I imagine a good restaurant for vegans and vegetarians (I'm not vegetarian myself).\n\nReviewing the food alone, I would give it 3 stars. The options are limited and you have to serve yourself. I got a plate of food for 8 euros, filling half with the warm entrees and the other half with cold sides. I saw some folks buying food from the fridge and was told that they can heat it up in a microwave. The food itself was good but you have to serve yourself. The reason why I give it 4 stars is because I appreciated the atmosphere. It's bright, sunny, and has a cozy-type feel. (When I went, there was only one other person there. )\n\nAll in all, good place for young travelers with a small budget.",
            "The place is close to the Eiffel Tower, but not to close to be crowded with tourist. People there were really gentle, and were very thorough when explaining the menu. Speaking English and Italian :)\nThe lentils with curry, and the home made bread were simple delicious. They told us the veggies are picked from small gardens.\nMy husband and I enjoyed being there.",
            "This place is vegetarian cafeteria style eating. The food was good, but not too complicated. Like the hot bar at Wholefoods except more flavorful. Also like the hot bar at Wholefoods, it's slightly more expensive than you think it should be. It was good in general but not amazing, some of items definitely seemed like they had been sitting out. The cashier here was super nice. She was very friendly and took the time to tell us what was vegan and what wasn't. Some other staff people did make us feel slightly rushed at the end. We came at around 9 but were assured that it was fine because they would close at 10, but people started clearing our table at 9:30, and 9:45 somebody came and told us that they were closing. They apparently are dog friendly because two people had off leash dogs. I don't think I'd come back for dinner but it seems like the perfect place for lunch.",
            "Vegetarian, moderately priced cafe with a buffet. The staff was very friendly and quickly pointed out what the vegan options were upon inquiry. There were quite some vegan options, though they were not labeled. The food was healthy and tasty. Not appropriate for dining out but definitely a good place for a quick bite.\n\nPros: Healthy, Friendly staff\nCons: Vegan options are not labeled",
            "UM.... WOW! went here today and what a gem! The food is absolutely delish. The staff was incredibly nice and I did not eat one thing I did not like. If you are a vegan, vegetarian, carnivore- whatever .... you must eat here. So so so good"

            "Can't say enough good things about this place! Firstly, best baked falafel I've ever had, plus the awesome sauces (no pun)- white and spicy, so yummy!\nNeatly, lots of options for creating the meal of your choice with options for solo entree, sides, drinks, and dessert add-ons. (Get the ginger beer- it was very zesty/spicy!)\nThey have a copy of their menu in English- just ask, plus the staff was friendly and spoke English if necessary.\nQuick, inexpensive, friendly staff, vegan- really, how could you go wrong?",
            "When the service makes the food taste even better.\n\nSo if you're vegan, this is the way to go. We came here on our last day in Paris and kind of happenstanced upon it (if that is a term). Basically, the S.O. was looking for something fresh to eat and we tried to go to another vegan place in the area at first which was closed (Laelo - now cafe Marlette). We then tried to go to Le Potager de Charlotte....whoops...turns out you needed a reservation.... and then in our hunger, stumbled into a Vietnamese restaurant which usually has at least some vegetarian options. Good thing we didn't stay...we were on a mission to find a vegan restaurant for \"le déjeuner\"\n\nBecause of the time constraints and increasing levels of hunger, I let S.O. to the search for something that would be satisfactory to her... She found Juicy and Tasty and thank goodness she did.\n\nThe \"how\" of ordering was explained to us and with patience which was so appreciated. And the food was definitely fulfilling. I ordered the bowl of salad combo with drink and desert. So worth it!\n\nI highly recommend Juicy and Tasty. This is a good place to both sit in and eat as well as get something to go.",
            "It's All in the Name!\n\nThe food was definitely tasty. We had a gyro wrap and a Saigon wrap, and they were both excellent!\n\nThe guys who were working were very accommodating and downright friendly. Our French was pathetic, so we relied on their better-than-okay English.\n\nHighly recommend!",
            "Passed by and walked in to get a nice and fruity juice as a snack. Couldn't have chosen better.\n\nThe place is small and the guy that runs it was right there with a big smile, ready to help. I wanted a smoothie but wasn't sure about my choice, so he started to tell me in a very decent English (not that common in Paris) all the possible choices, including all the preferences from clients and recommendatios from himself. He even suggested me to create my own so I could drink it from whatever ingredients I choose. I also wanted to make sure there was no sugar added or artificial powders in the smoothie: he explained to me very kindly that they just make the beverages out from the natural fruits.\n\nWe finally decided to try the combination of pineapple, bananas, apple juice and some coconut water and it was pretty good. It was more like a juice but tasted fresh.\n\nI checked the menu and they have such a good deals for breakfast or snacking during the day. If you're looking for a healthy bite and a nice service, pass by!",

            "I found this restaurant on TikTok and after going here I can say its a bit over hyped and is popular for it's aesthetic and not for it's taste. Waited on a 15 min line, which didn't feel too long. All the tables are pretty close together. Service is amazing, the waiters checked in on us multiple times. My family and I don't speak french and it was nice that the waiters also spoke english and we didn't have to use google translate (which we wouldn't have minded). They also have an english menu! which helped tons. Overall the restaurant was a-bit average. Next time I'm in paris, I would most likely skip this.\n\nGreen pancakes- looks cute but it tasted a bit bland and couldn't finish it; the maple syrup was good. 4/10\n\nAvocado Benedict with salmon- salmon and the poached eggs were super good. If i were to come to this restaurant again, I would definitely order this for the second time but i'd switch the muffin base with toast (if possible). 8/10\n\nScrambled eggs with bacon- my mom ordered this and she liked it. I had a couple bites and thought it tasted pretty normal, like how scrambled eggs and bacon would taste when you make it at home. 7.5/10\n\nsweet potato fries- superrrrr yum! would argue that it was my favorite thing on the menu. I don't know what sauce it is that they give on the side but it's really good. 1000/10\n\nrose latte- I love floral drinks and it looked really pretty! 10/10\nlavender latte- It was okay, i prefer the rose latte over this. 7/10\nchai latte- doesn't taste like the typical chai latte you would receive at starbucks but more like an indian masala chai, which I love! 8.5/10",
            "Best brunch i've had in Paris. Went with a few friends and came back the next day alone. Love the menu and how fresh everything is. The french toast with tahini was out of this world honestly.\nThe decor is nice and our waiter was such a sweetheart. Only con is the space is somewhat narrow and you have to get up to pay. Other than that I have nothing else to say.\nLe dimanche c'est achalandé et ils ne prennent pas de réservation donc essayer d'y aller le\nPlus tot que possible:)",
            "Keywords: disappointing, overpriced, no service, never coming back\n\nWhy I dislike this place: First of all, I must point out the biggest problem of this restaurant--too much Instagram marketing. I wouldn't mind if the quality of the food and service of the staff fit the expectation that Season's instagram strategy has created. But, what I have experienced (in addition to 1-hour queue outside of the restaurant) was the bad quality of food and 0-service. In terms of the food: 1. the pancake was dry as a sponge. In terms of the service: 1. we ordered two oatmeal bowls, the staff brought only one bowl to our table and said \"we run out of oats, so you can just share.\" I mean, what??!! Without our consent, they just changed the order?? 2. I suppose because the restaurant was EXTREMELY CROWDED, nobody came to our table and checked whether the food was okay.\n\nSuggestions: if you can't serve and satisfy customers' needs, don't take and serve MANY customers at the same time! Improving the food quality and maintaining the restaurant's service is the key point. Instead of spending time and putting effort on Instagram marketing, Season should really focus on its employees training to fit the customer expectation.",
            "Hmm ... Ok so not sure how anyone can mess up Salmon Avocado Toast ...\nSalmon: OK it's raw. I was expecting it to be smoked since Paris is known for its smoked salmon.\nDressing: here comes the weird part. It had white sesame seeds, sesame oil, vinaigrette, some paprika. Underneath raw salmon, was the cream cheese. (Or was it goat cheese)\n\nOK, someone tell me what the heck am I eating? I was thinking was I missing wasabi or ginger, or benedict sauce, or what is it?!\n\nAnyway, I regretted not searching for regular bakery store nearby for authentic French Bakery.\n\nShould of, could of, would of.\n\nTwo stars for Fluent Enlgish waiters and cute decor.\n\nNext !",
            "Fast service and the first time I had \"savory\" breakfast pancakes. My favorite, however, was the \"pancakes caramel\" which is both instagrammable and delicious. Get here early to avoid crowds or a wait."

I was intrigued by the healthy vegetarian vibe. It's conveniently located near the Saint Lazare train station.\n\nThis works a bit like a cafeteria or Pret-A-Manger. They have meal deals where you can get an entree, side and drink, or you can purchase items a la carte. I opted for a fresh cod bowl with a side lentil salad. If you don't like lentils, avoid this place. It seemed like almost everything had lentils in it! This could've been because we arrived late at night, right before closing, and there weren't a lot of options still available that late in the day.\n\nThey have a microwave with reheating instructions so you'll get it perfect. Plenty of seating, and they sell wine and beer too. Credit cards are accepted and even if you don't speak French, you can figure out how everything works here. I mean, you see your food before you purchase it so that removes a bit of the language barrier.\n\nClean with friendly employees and reasonable portions. A great place if you're a vegan or vegetarian, and even meat eaters looking for healthy options will like this.\n\nIt's not worth a special trip to eat here (since Paris is the world's culinary capital after all), but even in this city everyday fast food is still a mini gourmet experience.",

            "Incredible little spot. One large table inside. The juices are all made to order. I got apple, beet, lemon, ginger and it was amazing. The woman working was so sweet as well! The interior is so vibey!",
            "Despite this place being relatively small, if not tiny, with one a large table with about eight chairs about it, in a space that screams walking closet to any passerby's, the place is a true hidden gem. Well actually it's not so hidden as the bright blue exterior will catch anyone's eye. Or maybe it's the wooden bench right in front? Not sure but either way, one should never judge such a place until they actually try it. And since I was in Paris for twelve days and this establishment was trending on here, and was very highly rated, I had to check it out.\n\nFast-forward our long subway commute, crossing half of Paris in the process and we walked right out. I wiped out by smartphone and used Google Maps to orient myself and proceed to walk over from the Métro République. A short walk and one that proved to be worthwhile. Finding the place was easy although it isn't on a major street, instead a modest one way street but we walked right in. We didn't have lunch in mind and instead settled for some fresh juice and some berry-loaded muffins.\n\nAfter being greeted, we glanced to our right, on the wall, where a list of today's items was prominently written. Including this smoothie which we ended up ordering, which featured some blueberries, orange juice, pineapple, mint and banana. While not all of it was made to order, most of it was and it came out tasting absolutely delicious. It was simple and yet the depth of flavor and lack of chemicals and various additives made for a real treat for my tastebuds and my body. Every sip left me feeling refreshed and feeling great.\n\nAlong with it, as I had mentioned, I had a berry muffin which was rather small and pretty tasty none the less although not the best one I've ever had. It was however vegan I believe, something that I determined by the type of flour that seemed to be used it in, giving it a deep brown color.\n\nBut those items item, Bob's, despite it's size, offers plenty more options from toast and bagels, to cookies and salads. There were also a few more juice/smoothie options for us to chose from. But what really struck me was the decor and ambiance in the place. it was rustic, simple and had no frills whatsoever. There was a table, a few seats around it and on top of it was three community bread baskets where sliced pieces of baguette could be grabbed, a few knives and forks, chopsticks and well... that was about it. On the wall adjacent to the table were a few cookbooks and a large water container with some cups next to it. Oh and also some random items for sale like tiny muffin tins and other quirky items.\n\nThere was very little else going on and that was one of the things that truly made it special. A nice breathe of fresh air from the usual bakeries, cafes and various other establishments. However do know that this place is cash only, something that left me slightly annoyed but the friendly service there made up for it.",
            "This ain't no Jamba Juice. There's no sherbet here or power boosts or any other additives. Just fruit. Real fruit, seriously, I saw the guy cut up the fruit too. Today's special consisted of orange, pineapple, bananas and strawberries.\n\nYah, they can make other fruit drinks to your liking, but they have the daily menu on the wall so it is preferred to go with the program. My drink was nice, smooth, fresh, cold, and straight from the blender.\n\nHad a great conversation with one of the managers, JP. He talked about the background of Bob's juice bar, which, there is no actual Bob, by the way, just named Bob from Mark the owner who likes Bob Dylan songs, I guess.\n\nAnyway, they make some pretty darn good muffins, straight from the oven. I got their apple pear muffin. Nice and warm. It's a great little juice bar to get you going in the mornings, especially if you're not a coffee guy like me or if you want a change of scenery from the typical brasseries and cafe places on essentially every block in Paris.",
            "Starbucks talks a big game about third place, but Bob's Juice Bar actually embodies it! An anchor in the 10th arrondissement, this cozy commune is about a lot more than juice.\n\nI quite fancy the fabulous futomaki and the sandwiches are super too. While Paris may not be known for its variety for vegans and vegetarians, Bob's is a beacon of hope for folks who have chosen plant-based diets.\n\nIf I lived nearby, I'd take lunch here three times a week. And I'd make sure I had cash to pay for it because Bob's doesn't take cards.",
            "If you've gorged yourself on cheese and foie gras for five days, you might need to cleanse yourself a bit. Bob's got you.\n\nAll the juices are made from the most delicious of ripe, fresh fruit, and are well worth the somewhat steep prices for somewhat small servings. And as the name indicates, they are English-speakers who are friendly, happy, and helpful."

Totally delicious, authentic Thai food if I was back in the area, I would definitely come back!"

            "Ok so let's talk about Sangeetha and why I'm giving it such a high rating.\n\nSangeetha is located down the street from a couple of other Indian restaurants. We tried a couple of the other places down the street, but hands down Sangeetha was the best and most accommodating to our dietary restrictions. Certain members of my family eat a semi-Jain diet and do not eat any food items with onion or garlic in it. Because of this, traveling can be quite difficult and it's often very hard for them to find food items that they can eat, especially while abroad.\n\nThis restaurant was very understanding about their dietary restrictions and was able to modify dishes for them so they could actually have a full meal. Service was great and the interior was clean. Chaat service does end at a certain time so you can't get it later in the day, but their menu is still pretty appealing. Honestly, one of the better Indian restaurants in Paris esp if you have dietary issues.",
            "Visiting Paris from the US I decided to give Sangeetha a try. It wasn't anything spectacular, and it wasn't terrible. It was above average. I had the Dahi Poori, Gobi Manchurian, Rava Masala Dosa.\n\nThe Dahi Poori is a lot smaller in portion size than the poster on the wall leads one to believe and you only get 8. They're pretty bite size and half the size of a typical Poori you'd find in India, or most other restaurants. The Gobi Manchurian was tasty, and not that spicy compared to other restaurants we've been to. The sauce was a bit oily/watery but the flavor was still there. The Rava Masala Dosa was also average but the disappointing part was the small portion size of the sambhar. They only give 3 spoonfuls before you're wanting more because it's that good. I believe you can order a large bowl for two people to share but it's an extra cost.\n\nThe service is great, the tables and restaurant are clean, and there is free tap water which is always appreciated as someone traveling around. Since it's on a street with many other Indian restaurants I'm sure you can find one better, but you can't go wrong if you decide to eat here.",
            "Utterly fabulous vegetarian restaurant using stainless dishes ! Price fix menu €12 for the Southern Indian meal is highly recommended.\nEnglish spoken here, very friendly attitudes, and absolutely delicious vegetarian food! Very near the best money exchange rates in Paris, which is Tempo on Magenta.\nThis is the one you gotta try folks!",
            "Food is just OK. The dosas are thick and ordinary. They are relatively small, eg a paper dosa anywhere else would be good 2 ft long and paper thin, here it is around a foot and no different than a standard dosa. Vada sambhar was soggy. Sambhar wasn't up to the mark, neither were the chutneys. Filter coffee is meh. Service is very slow. Will not go back.",
            "This is my go-to Indian restaurant in Paris. Authentic and fresh. I'm always pleasantly surprised at how delicious it is. My favourite dishes are the North Indian thali, palak paneer and aloo gobi.\n\nDon't leave without having the delicious dessert, rava kesari! Amazing, soft, sweet and rich!\n\nNext time will take photos!"

Had the vegan tofu sandwich, lentil soup and a green smoothie. Cafeteria style service and microwave available to heat up food. Ample seating and clean restrooms which you need a code to enter that is listed on your receipt. Love the atmosphere of this place. Fresh, fast, clean and tasty.",
            "Great vegan-friendly health food place to grab some quick take away or sit down and enjoy a coffee and salad. Their food looks healthy and fresh. All ingredients are listed and they use some helpful label to easily tell if something is vegetarian, dairy-free or gluten-free.\n\nThe interior is simple but nice with a bicycle theme. It is self-service, but the staff was quite friendly and helpful.\n\nThey could improve by having a vegan label as well; by having more vegan options (there were no vegan desserts for example); and by using real glasses, plates and cutlery (they only had disposable ones).\n\nPrices were more than fair. The location is really convenient, right next to Lafayette. I will certainly be back here again for a quick bite.\n\nPros: Healthy food, all ingredients listed, vegetarian and and dairy-free labeling, fair prices, vegan-friendly.\n\nCons: No vegan label, they could do with more vegan options, disposable glasses, dishes and cutlery",
            "Great healthy food with a reasonable price tag. Tip1: come before 11, many coffee are discounted. Tip2: they do have sandwich + small salad + drink combo or pastry + coffee combo. Fantastic!"

            "If you're in the Montparnasse area & you're looking for something relatively healthy & reasonably priced then you're in luck! Exki is like a miniature cafeteria with decent food, a nice ambience, & a lot of space (in the back, there's a large seating area). I ended up getting a meal deal with a sandwich, sparkling water, and a side salad for 8,70 euros. You have a variety of options with their meal deals, for instance you can get a soup rather than a side salad & you have a good amount of sandwiches to choose from. The Olivia sandwich that I got was okay but I ended up really liking the Monaco salad I chose (It has couscous & smoked salmon in it!).\n\nI found the 2 ladies working behind the counter of Exki to be friendly & I liked how relaxed this place is with the self-service style. This is a nice, no-pressure place to stop for food when you're in need of a lunch on the run or you just want a little rest-stop during your day.",

It was surreal eating at the bar and imagining the pandemonium that occurred during the attacks.\n\nThe menu is completely in French. It's affordable. The cheapest item is 10 euro. If you enjoy Vietnamese bun thit nuong, or the vermicelli bowls, this is a great choice. The rice noodle used is more akin to banh hoi. It's very fine. The rice noodle bowl isn't quite like traditional vietnamese noodle bowl, but I don't think that's necessarily the restaurant's vision.\n\nThe ambience is lively and very poppin' lol. Luckily I dined alone so I was able to easily score a seat.",

I checked with my best friend- who is Cambodian btw, and he said that the food was not prepared right.\n\nI ordered vegetarian Natin and it was slop. Disgusting slop. I at the plain rice and the pineapple I ordered. And couldn't drink the hibiscus drink because it spilt everywhere when the driver was delivering it.\n\nMajor miss for me.

The price tag of one of these bowl of soups were 14 Euros and friends please do yourself a favor and don't get this. I took two bites and had to push it aside it was basically water and noodles thats all the flavors that it had.\n\nIn total we paid a miserable 48 euros for a shitty bowl of Kathew, imitation beef lok lak, egg rolls, lemonade and soda. Not a good day for us.\n\n\nComing all the way from Long Beach and being Cambodian myself I figured hek, it might not be as close to Cambodia or even in the states but atleast its Cambodian and they can't fuck up cambodian food. But today they did they truly truly did.",
            "We found this restaurant by chance as a referral from our hosting air bnb but the food was very delicious. We ordered the Bobun special, one beef and one shrimp. The portion sizes are filling and the waiting staff very friend even for those who French may not be their first language (us). This was my first time trying this particular dish but I would definitely go back a second time. The special includes a type of spring roll that is mixed in with the vermicelli, there is also fresh mint, carrots, and salad mixture that adds to the flavorful dish. I did prefer the beef special over the shrimp just because the beef was more flavorful but this place is definitely worth trying."

            "It's insanely hard to eat vegetarian in France unless you know what you're doing. Every little sauce or topping has bacon bits and what not mixed in it. I was lucky to have this place right across from the place I was staying in Montparnasse many years ago.\n\nI was served by this guy named Richard and he was so nice--very helpful. Also, I met a lot of Americans from Seattle and Portland there (they have a high concentration of vegetarians). Since my French sucked, it was cool to freely talk English after not for two days.\n\nDuring my stay, I must have gone back to Aquarius three more times. They serve things that sound like meat, but they are not. The food was great, the atmosphere mellow.",
            "Quite underwhelmed by this restaurant. I like to support vegetarian restaurants, and was predisposed to like this one, but was put off by several things. Apparently you need to have reservations for this restaurant. The waiter nevertheless seated us in the empty second room. That was fine until a single woman came in and was seated right next to us. She was clearly uncomfortable. There were signs on several tables saying reserved, but others were empty, and a couple came in afterwards and seated themselves at one of those tables. Clearly there was no need to push us together.\nAs for the food, it was subpar. Both my husbands lasagna and my dish were oversalted (mine tasted like it had too much soy sauce), and it overwhelmed the vegetables. I had puff pastry on top of mushrooms as part of my meal and the pastry was hard to cut through, as was the lasagna my husband ordered. The dishes sounded much better than they turned out tasting.\nThis is a well known vegetarian restaurant. It seems that they are resting on their laurels now, and have abandoned the idea of well executed food (vegetarian or not), and the concept of pleasing the customer.",

            "Conflit de conscience sur ce restaurant. D'un côté, la carte est variée, l'assiette bien composée et le décor agréable. Cela faisait longtemps que j'attendais de pouvoir tester ce restaurant. Mais cette expérience a été gâchée par un service pas totalement à la hauteur. Efficace certes, mais pas vraiment souriant et surtout pas vraiment commercial. Cela devait être la faute à pas de chance mais j'ai retrouvé un bout de plastique dans ma salade. En le faisant remarquer à la serveuse, personne n'a pris la peine de changer mon assiette ce qui pour moi aurait été la moindre des choses. On m'a juste expliqué que cela était du à l'emballage sous plastique de la salade. Et au moment de l'addition, on ne m'a pas naturellement proposé un geste commercial ne serait ce qu'un café. Je l'ai fait remarquer et l'on m'a tout de même offert le jus de carottes. Bref, vous comprendrez que retrouver du plastique dans un repas vegan, ça gâche un peu l'expérience... Dommage car sinon tout était très bon."

            "Cute takeaway place. Food is ok.\n\nThere are not many vegan options. The breakfast muesli bowl with berries was small but not bad.",
            "This was a great quick pit stop while in Paris. They serve a variety of healthy items as well as an array of different desserts and pastries. Good fruity drinks and smoothies to wash them down with as well. I honestly think my favorite part was the fact that if you get a hot dish such as pasta you can heat it up yourself at the microwave. Easy instructions guide you on the proper timing of your meal. It was located directly across the street from our flat.",
            "I'm not sure why all the bad reviews. Is this place amazing? No. But then so are most of the places around.\n\nThis one is convenient because there is almost always a table available outside.\n\nTheir coffee is good, and the food is alright for the price.\n\nAfter trying to sit down for breakfast elsewhere, multiple times, we've decided to not reinvent the wheel, and just keep coming there - everything is fresh, and the service is done with a smile.",
            "They have a lot of choice from salads to soups to hot meals ... you truly have the choice. There is nothing exceptional about the place but it is a convenient restaurant to stop and have a quick healthy lunch",
            "Exki is a cross between Panera and Starbucks, for those using an American frame of reference. On a very busy afternoon you can probably just sneak in and sit down and use the wifi. When it's not that crowded, however, an employee might come over to you and ask you what you want, at which point you act like you were going to order an espresso all along (not a lot - the organic is not even 2 euros) when the reality is you were just putting your feet up until your laundry was done.\n\nClean, comfortable, friendly. Good coffee and food."

I was excited to see the Mexican colors and decor from the outside and I missed some Mexican food so I decided to go inside. We started off with what I thought were suppose to be nachos but what I got was a plate of 5 cool ranch Doritos with microwaved beans and cheese on top. For my main plate I ordered a chalupa with rice and beans, they gave me a plate of chicken curry with more microwaved beans (half burnt and half cold) and flavorless rice. Got to my hotel and had diarrhea the rest of the night."

Its perfect for vegetarians too or if you are on a high protein diet.\n\nNice atmosphere, clean, modern design, friendly staff, relatively cheap prices too and a nice view of the church across the street. This is one of those must-have places somewhere near you."

There are also delicious fresh juices like the watermelon mint juice that I had.\n\nIn this neighborhood in the middle of town are many Asian restaurant and sushi bars and such, but Nest is really something else. It is a light and airy place, with cute and colorful details, a lovely staff who speaks perfect English and is in for a chat.\n\nI look forward to visiting this place again.",
            "Stumbled across this place with a friend and we really found a gem. Whilst the decor is a little cold, the simple and cheap vietnamese food makes up for it. I had a delicious bowl of noodles and pork whilst my friend had the burger with tofu. I loved the flavour combinations but the pork was a bit too much for me a little fatty and the flavours were too strong. However the rest of the dish was delicious and my friend really enjoyed her burger.\n\nThere are plenty of veggie options as well as gluten and dairy free which I love. They even have vegan and gluten free cakes which is such a treat (although we didn't have any).\n\nI would recommend for an interesting experience and good and inexpensive food!",
            "Loved the spring rolls, banh mi, and tapioca dessert. Delicious food. Small, cute restaurant. Definitely worth it. I'll be back.",
            "The bahn mi burger was incredible! Every bite was so delicious! And the salad to accompany it was great also. The shrimp salad was very good and the spring rolls were ok. Both desserts were good but the banana one was the best!",
            "We were recommended to try Nest by their neighbors at Telescope Coffee when we asked about nearby veggie-friendly options. Nest saved our day, serving up their burger (subbed avocado), salad and spring rolls. The juice menu was also very appetizing, and we plan to stop by again soon to try more."

            "Napalm sriracha burger is my ultimate favourite and the fries were good too.\nThis is my favourite burger joint in Paris and I have to say that I tried many ones before. First the service is super friendly so we feel welcomed and it adds to a perfect lunch break. Second the quality of the burger is equal to the first time I tried like 2 years ago which is a guarantee of care about ingredients.\nTheir lemonade is not too sweet and they would be happy to add some syrup if you do care.\n15 euros for a lunch with burger/fries/ drink it is a good deal.",
            "We are Americans on holiday in Paris. This American style restaurant is featured in a book written by an American journalist. We were not disappointed. The burgers were moist and not over cooked. The buns tasted fresh. The mayo spread was delicious. Our fries were crispy, not greasy. All in all they satisfied our craving for a good American burger. The service was fast and friendly even though they were very busy. We highly recommend the PNY.",
            "I totally underestimated how popular this place is. Causally suggesting that a friend and I meet here on a Thursday night turned into a fight-for-you-right-to-dine adventure full of visual candy, socio-cultural intrigue, and damn good burgers.\n\nLet's start with the crowd: 100% hipster, average age 26.5 and not a false stylistic note to be found anywhere in the establishment. Forget the clubs and bars, ladies and gents, if you want to attract the trendy crowd the magic formula is burgers with a New York spin on the Faubourg Saint Denis.\n\nIt took a solid 30-minute wait at the bar before a server actually ejected two guys who had been nurturing their Duvals over a liesurely chat in order to seat us.\n\nThe relaxed waiter understandably mocked us for having a hard time choosing between the three burgers on the menu. I went with the vintage cheeseburger, my friend for the california (a cheeseburger with avocado) coupled with loaded fries and a carafe of house wine.\n\nThe food really hit the spot.The burger bun light and fluffy, the beef, nicely charred on the outside and tender and succulent on the inside, and the vintage cheese, SHARP, just the way it should be! The fries were a bit limp and skinny, not nearly as impressive as the burger but still nice.\n\nOverall, the experience was yummy and fun, if not a bit hectic and unpolished at the beginning and end (they screwed up our bill by a good extra 20E, and weren't the least bit apologetic about it, so be sure to check the bill carefully)."

            "This is a vegetarian's delight. My wife and I came to this place two nights in a row to have dinner. We tried different things on the menu and left very happy and satiated. Inside seating is spacious, and outside is nice too if you don't mind people smoking around you (which seems pretty common in Paris). The staff is very good and helped us with the menu choices. We had the falafel, goat cheese, energy super bowl, mozzarella and tomato, quinoa bowl and a couple of other dishes and they were all great. After stumbling through Paris in search of decent vegetarian food, we found this right close to where we stayed and in a great location.\n\nIf you are a vegetarian, you will be happy with this place. Even otherwise I recommend giving this a try...they seems to have quality ingredients, so I'm sure most things taste great. Their dessert menu is pretty extensive, though we didn't try any. Overall, very happy with this find...great place to enjoy a nice evening",
            "We ordered the Paradis du Paradis, which is a sampling of some of their best items. There's a two person minimum at 22 Euros per person. It was a nice treat and there wasn't anything on the platter that we didn't like. It looked like a lot of food but it ended up being the perfect amount. My only complaint is that the service was sooooo slow. We didn't order dessert, but did see the desserts coming out for other guests and they looked amazing. If the opportunity presents itself, I'd definitely go back to try the dessert menu.",

Love the energy here as there is so much to do, but not too busy. Food is great for a healthy bite, especially if you are a little sick of heavy french brasseries. It felt so good to finally have something fresh and healthy without a large bill.",
            "This place is amazing!!! I have been here a few times on different visits to Paris. Juices are spectacular! Food is healthful and reasonably priced. The dessert options stellar. A gluten free chow desert to DIE for I have lots of dietary restrictions. This restaurant is a haven for me.",
            "This is a chain restaurant so you can visit various locations or stands but I have to say that this location is the most beautiful. If you are looking for a juice and snack Gare De Nord has a stand there too.\n\nThis particular location is right next to St. Michel and you can see Notre Dame if you eat outside. So it's a beautiful place to relax, take in the scene, and sip on fresh pressed juice or a cocktail. They also have salads, fruit plates, and desserts if you're hungry!"

There's mismatched furniture, the kids are allowed to write on the walls, and there's green shag carpet. Depending on your personal style, these things can be good or bad. They have a large selection of homemade cakes and juices (many bio/organic), and even a few nods to North America kid culture with hot dogs, pizza on sticks, and pancakes on the menu. I'm still perplexed as to why parent-kid cafés don't uniformly have at least beer on the menu. It would make the whole experience so much happier for parents. But I digress... While the price for basic items like tea and coffee are fair, the menus for brunch and some of the other food items are somewhat high. But, I got a cup of tea and a pancake plus and hour and a half of my child being entertained by other kids for 3,50€. Can't complain. This place caters to the international crowd, as the staff speak a number of languages and many of their workshops (ateliers) are in English."

It came with a lot of sliced steak, mushrooms, onion, cheese rich marinara sauce, and an egg to top it all off. It also came with a very spicy packet of hot sauce that is filled with pepper flakes.

The server and waiter were really rude and insulting, we reached the restaurant at 3:03 pm and they told us they are not serving anything else but only two Thalia's. All three of us were really hungry and decided to sit down and eat, as soon as we sat down we ordered Thalia's and we noticed that the waiter was getting other dishes on other tables, when asked he said only if we ordered before 3 he could have accepted that.\n\nWell anyway, going forward, I asked him if I can charge my phone for a little bit, he said no. You can keep your phone outside (outside the restaurant he means) to charge it and we were eating lunch inside. I don't know why did he even suggest that.\n\nMoving forward, our thali's came and it had only one roti and small amount of rice we asked him if we can get an extra roti bread he said NO. He will give us extra roti only if we order another thali. REALLY? You kidding me? You can't give us extra roti?\n\nOverall, the food was not fresh and tasted at least 2-3 days old, oh and not to forget Me, my dad and my friend we all were sick since that night for next three days in Paris.\n\nWhat a worst decision to go here",

There are two locations but we tried the one nearest the Louvre. The Gobi is dry which is usually my favorite but there wasn't much flavor. The chutney they served it with however was superb. The thali was a good choice compared to the puddu. We did not get to try some of the North Indian dishes on the menu nor the cocktails as they were not serving any that day. If you want authentic South Indian food this is not it.",

            "I went to this Exki right after running La Parisienne nearby so I can understand why the food selection was so limited (assuming that many other runners also made the lengthy walk to Exki after the race even though it was not so close to the event); what I wouldn't understand is why their menu option only featured teas with about 15 grams of sugar (regardless of if that 15 grams came from a natural source like fruit juice). Not only was I disappointed with the overly-sweet beverages that were the sole meal-deal options (this season, as it is seasonal), but the employees were not very friendly in explaining that fact.\n\nFurthermore, the trash and cleanliness at this Exki is not well-maintained, as piles of dishes and food waste surround the trash and most tables have food crumbs and remains from previous customers. All in all, I would really only recommend this Exki if you can't find other budget-friendly food options, however, in the area of Paris where this Exki is located, that shouldn't be a problem as there are numerous non-expensive options nearby.",

            "Found this on along our way and surprised it didn't have any reviews before this one. Had to get my food to go, so I went with the first choice: the Veganita pizza. After ordering I realized that maybe I should've asked what's in it, but trusting my gut was a great idea: the pizza is basically on a crisp fajita-like bread with sauce and vegan cheese and fresh basil leaves. I got the small and it was perfect size to go for 5 €. Really glad I found this place!",
            "Sadly, really bad. E ordered a gluten free pizza, the crust was soggy with oil. I ordered the samosas. The outside of the Somasas were barely warm and when I bit into them discovered the inside was still cold. I told the server who took them away, and 10 minutes later brought them back out... the same ones with a bit taken out of them... and amazingly the inside was now still barley warm. I think their microwave is broken...\n\nVegan and Gluten Free food doesn't have to be bad... find somewhere else.",
            "I passed by this place a couple of times walking into the center of Paris from my Airbnb. I stopped in there with some friends, and I am so glad I did. I got the mini Veganita (perfect size for one person) and a organic can of Cola for 8 euros. It was delicious! My friend got the pesto (pistou) pizza in the regular size, and it was huge. I didn't take a picture of it, but it was definitely big enough for two people to share. She ended up taking half of it home. Overall, very glad I stopped in. It was delicious! I loved that their cheese (cashews) was homemade."

The combination platters are a good deal, though the pita is surprisingly meh. Best place for a quick, decent meal in the neighborhood, since other options (namely General Beuret) are slow, greasy, and packed."

            "It pays to change habits and walk down a street you've never taken to see what secrets it behold, like this totally spacious, cool-looking veggie-centric lunch spot near the Grands Boulevard. After examining the space and menu and eyeballing their daily Dukan diet option (though I'm not on the diet, I wouldn't be opposed to trying it out for a meal...) I came back the next day for lunch.\n\nNew to the place I asked a lot of questions and was greeted with friendly, helpful answers. After getting an explanation about everything available that day (gosh darn it, there was no Dukan diet option !) I picked up a lentil salad with roasted veggies and half a cup of mushroom soup for a reasonable 7.40E. The soup was great, but a little salty, and the salad un peu drab (could have used the extra salt from the soup..). I wouldn't say my mouth was in heaven, but it was a good, reasonable, healthy lunch that I'd be happy having again."

            "An excellent location in the 2nd right next to the Pompidou. Fair amount of indoor seating and clean bathrooms. Add wifi and you've got a good place to get some work done in the dead middle of the city. You'll need to buy something though. Unlike Starbucks, they don't welcome freeloaders.",
            "Food was okay, many healthful options. It is a bit pricey - paid over 10 euros for a slice of quiche and container of a small lentil/onion salad. I think the best quality is that most food is locally sourced and they attempt to be environmental friendly."
