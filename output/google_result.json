            "I don‚Äôt usually seek out vegan places and will usually eat anything, an omnivore if you will. But I do love food and in the sea of mediocre French bistros catered to tourists looking for caricatures of French cuisine, food made creatively and with passion need planning and time to seek out.\n\nLe Potager du Marais deserves to be one such establishment though it was a place I just chanced upon. I already had lunch so I had only the French onion soup, and it was truly delicious and might be one of the best specimens I‚Äôve had.\n\nLooking at what my neighbours at the next table are eating. It looks like a return to visit needs to be planned.",
            "Cozy and down to earth restaurant offering all traditional French dishes. The buckwheat crepe with mushrooms, leeks and veggies was delicious. The mains came with a decent amount of salad as well. The french onion soup was good just a bit salty.",

To enjoy French vegan food is such a unique experience (as an overseas traveller) and I'm grateful for this restaurant providing the opportunity to enjoy some very fine French cuisine! Our waiter was wonderful, attentive and made our night fun. The French onion soup is a must if you're visiting! I feel like I'd travel to Paris again just for the soup! Merci beaucoup üôè",

The service is attentive and helpful, enhancing the dining experience. However, the tables are bare and napkins are thin paper (and only one is offered). Worse is the restroom, located in the courtyard, which is in dire need of maintenance, which detracts from the overall experience. Additionally, the ‚Ç¨4.5 charge for carbonated tap water, labeled as \"micro filtered,\" feels excessive. While the food and service are commendable, these inconveniences could affect repeat visits.

            "Excellent. Great blend of noticeable flavours. Mixture of hearty and light options. Simple, affordable, well designed menu. Wine was perfect also, and the different soft drinks options (not having the standard Coke and Fanta) shows effort, innovation, and thought about customer experience.\nI would return without hesitation.

It was incredible!\n\n(I also ordered their mac and cheese with vegan chicken and parmesan that was incredible. Just be warned I ordered the smallest bowl for 8‚Ç¨ and I ended up sharing it with my partner because it was so big!)\n\nWe were all stuffed after eating it all but still made room for dessert.\n\nI had their take on the Snickers bar in cake form and it was better than the real thing. My partner loved hers and our friend had nothing but great words with theirs.\n\nThey also have a mini shop inside the restaurant that sells almost everything they serve which would allow you to try your hand at making it yourself at home. If I wasn't visiting the city I would definitely stop here not just to eat but also shop!\n\nWould 100% recommend!",

I wasn‚Äôt expecting to be able to have most classic French dishes as a vegan, but I had a mouth-watering croque monsieur! I was so excited to get to have one in Paris!

Each burger was paired with different sauces that were all succulent and tasty as hell.

Trust us, they were demolished quickly because they were that good!\n\nOverall, Green Farmers delivers on flavor and service, making it a must-visit spot for vegan food lovers."

It wasn't busy when I arrived at 7:30 but it was packed when I left an hour or so later.\n\nI had the fried tempeh appetizer and the lasagna. The appetizer was good but not what I was expecting.  The tempeh was more of a paste that was formed into triangles and fried.  I didn't really see any individual soybeans.  Perhaps that's typical in Europe so I can't ding them for that.  Besides, it still tasted good.üòÅ\n\nNow on to the star of the show, the lasagna.   Most of the reviews said it was good and they were correct.  It's the best vegan lasagna I've had in the 8 years I've been vegan.

That's not really welcoming.\n\nIn the end she told me they could make a hummus without garlic and the salads without onions, and I said great. She went back to the kitchen, called the two chefs and the manager and had a discussion for 5 minutes laughing. Then both the waitress and the manager came to me and said they couldn't make anything with those allergies. Obviously they were too tired or bored to cook something fresh for me, even though their colleague had told me earlier that they could. Their menu consists of simple ingredients, if their kitchen is supposed to offer fresh food then they could just cook a plate of fresh stuff, but I guess that's not the case. Extremely disappointing. Poor attitude and service.\n\nThe tables are small, barely fit three plates, the music is too loud and if you're not French you should bring a dictionary."

The cake was also tasty, although I would have preferred a thicker raspberry cream layer on top to better balance the cashew cream layer.

            "Pretty good but I really wish this place offered a raw vegan salad main dish. They seem pretty into raw foods, they have raw desserts and even a raw pizza but not a raw salad on the menu (other than a tomato salad which is just sliced tomatoes so that's not a meal but more of a starter.) Since I was looking for a nice raw salad, I ordered the kale salad but removed the quinoa and sweet potato. Without those however the value at 16 euros was not there for the quantity given. So it would be great if there could create a nice raw salad, even using ingredients they already have in the kitchen for the correct price and quantity. I'm only giving it 3 stars because although I love the concept, the setting is beautiful, and the servers are kind, the food was also way too salty. I've had r salad two times in the last few months and both times were way over salted. I hope they can correct these things so I can update the score.

We started with the barbecue broccoli, which was a revelation‚Äîperfectly charred, tender, and bursting with smoky flavor. It was a wonderful introduction to the culinary journey that followed.\n\nNext, we enjoyed the mushroom tacos, which were rich and earthy, with a satisfying blend of textures. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection, and the tacos had a depth of flavor that made them truly memorable. The potatoes were another highlight‚Äîcrispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and seasoned just right.\n\nTo finish, we indulged in the roasted plum dessert.

We spent some time at other vegan places on our trip, but this was the best one by a long way! The staff were so friendly and inviting, really helpful, and fun as well. They really care about making you feel welcome and cosy. We decided to both have the no chicken tacos which at first seem quite expensive, but when you try them, they are 100% worth the cost. I'm more than happy to pay for this quality of food. The flavours are amazing, the produce is so fresh and locally sourced, and you can tell they have taken time to create the perfect balance of ingredients. The desserts and hot chocolates were absolutely delicious also, with no complaints. I'd happily spend all day there eating their food ü§ó\n\nThank you again for the amazing service!",

            "It's a very cozy place to find good vegan food. I was looking for food while I strolled on the streets of Paris around Norte Dame, and found it. The girl working there was Indian too, but was friendly and knew French too! Great experience!",

            "Delicious food and excellent service! We asked for the seitan escalope, the assiette zen, the assiette berbere, etc. We also asked for several desserts, like the browny. Weliked everything. Yorman was very kind."

We had no vegetables in any of the dishes, only meat replacements (which all had a strage consistency) and rice, which resulted in a sparse plate.\nOthers have left very positive reviews, but personally, the food was not to our taste.\n\nPositive: affordable prices."

The Bahn Mi is probably the best thing on the menu, though the a√ßa√≠ bowls and other items are absolutely worth trying. :)",

Everything else we had was great as well. Got some take away for our Versailles day trip. It was nice to eat something tasty on the lawn and not feel worried about if anything there could accommodate us.

They can also customise food without allium (no onions, no garlic). We ate there multiple times during our stay in Paris because the restaurant is clean, service is prompt, the food is delicious and of good value. Some of the dishes we tried were - fried rice, curry soup with vermicelli, basil tofu and curry claypot. Their coconut drink is also recommended - light and refreshing.",

Despite everyone receiving buzzers to indicate when their food was ready, not a single one went off in the time I was there, & every group had to go back downstairs to check when their food would be ready.

That sort of made up for the other two.\n\n4. With a few mixed results and because of slightly higher price tags, we didn‚Äôt feel like trying out the desserts during that visit.\n\nHope the restaurant continues to take the feedbacks constructively and keep improving further, reaching higher degrees of consistency in terms of taste, thus justifying the premium price tag.

He ended up having the whole slice by himself and I ordered another one for myself.\nI highly recommend this place and I can‚Äôt wait to go back and try different cakes and sweets.",

All good ingredients, but in the end severely lacked salt and spices, it was very bland. After steadily adding more and more salt finally it became a bit better, but then it had already turned cold ü§¶üèª\n\n2. We had ordered Apeti bowl, very colorful and nicely presented, turned out to be quite tasty as well. Buy I really wish if it were a warm bowl and if I had known in advance that it was a cold bowl.\n\n3. Then the lasagna. It was hot and nice, rich with flavors. That sort of made up for the other two.\n\n4. With a few mixed results and because of slightly higher price tags, we didn‚Äôt feel like trying out the desserts during that visit.\n\nHope the restaurant continues to take the feedbacks constructively and keep improving further, reaching higher degrees of consistency in terms of taste, thus justifying the premium price tag.

The ladies serving and cooking are charming and polite.\nThe food- we had the variety hummus plate. Unfortunately it was hard to distinguish between the various versions of hummus. Though I could feel that the food was good quality, it certainly packed in flavor.\nThen I came for their aubergine dishes and that day the aubergine did not get delivered. Well, if it's 1/3 of your menu then how come there were no contingency plans? Meaning every grocery store sells good quality aubergine in France/Paris.

            "Amazing owner Nicky, super serious about her cooking. Great concept and delicious food. All her sauces are homemade with love. The portion is huge and super affordable for the price. You can eat healthy without comprising the taste and quality.\nI took a mushroom bowl and my friend took the burger, we were so full we could barely walk."

            "One of the best, if not THE best lunch I've ever had.\nIt's a full vegan Japanese restaurant.\nFood is really well cared for, both aesthetically and in terms of ingredients.\nOverall everything is really clean and it has a good ambiance.\n\nI'm considering coming back to Paris just to eat here again.",
            "This place is perfect for vegans and vegetarians. If you‚Äôre a meat-eater, the appeal can be slightly reduced. The service is very fast and friendly. The chefs are Japanese and the food is good, but not outstanding. I would say this is more like a vegan version of Japanese fast food; in particular, the Udon salad sauce and the pickled onions are a bit too salty for my taste. If you‚Äôre used to outstanding Japanese food from coastal towns of the U.S., you might be slightly disappointed. Still, I would say it‚Äôs good Japanese food by Paris standards, and excellent by vegan standards. Portion-size is a bit small for the price. American Express accepted.",
            "This was the best dining experience we had in Paris...and we had some good ones. The flavours- delicious! The service- the finest The ambience - perfection! Most importantly our little boy ate more at this meal than any other. He devoured the tofu tapa and then the soy protein and rice bowl. He also sampled our soups and would have eaten those too if we hadn't objected.\nHighly recommend!",
            "Best place in Paris! The tantanmen was incredible - so rich and creamy. In addition, the space was so unique, cozy, and beautiful. I sat on the tatami upper level and had a great time enjoying the space and food. You must come here!",
            "We got Tantanmen ramen (17.5‚Ç¨), Teriyaki Don (16‚Ç¨) and Edamame (4‚Ç¨). Tantanmen has a tasty thick bouillon with beyond meat. They serve good vegan japanese food.\n\nMy second time, I tried the miso ramen, I think tantanmen is better in terms of bouillon taste. Miso ramen is lighter. We didn‚Äôt like the cafe gourmand except the matcha cookie, but the flan was good."

Our favorite for  both the food and the customer service! We are traveling to London next and our sweet waitress made us a little handwritten list of the best vegan options as well as areas/places to visit. Amazing all around. üòä",
            "highly recommend , a delightful gem in central Paris. This restaurant offers a refreshing twist on dining with its focus on fresh, organic, and healthy cuisine. The vibrant and innovative dishes are bursting with natural flavors, making every bite a delight. The staff are incredibly warm and friendly, adding to the overall charm. The inviting ambiance, filled with natural light and greenery, creates a perfect setting for a memorable meal. For a wholesome and unique dining experience in Paris, Charlie‚Äôs crew is an absolute must-visit",
            "This place is absolutely fabulous. Everyone can find something to eat here. It‚Äôs especially fabulous for anyone looking for gluten-free and vegan options. They do offer some dishes that are vegetarian. They make gluten-free bread in house, but they also offer regular bread but not in house made\n\nI had my favorite, which is the tofu scramble with the beautiful salad and warm small tomatoes. Everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly. My daughter had the chunacado sandwich With her homemade focaccia bread, which is gluten-free as well as vegan.   A new favorite dish of ours\n\nMost of their bake goods are gluten-free and vegan. Their chocolate chocolate cookie is so good and they have a in house made snickers bar and bounty bar in the cold case. This is the way to eat, especially if you‚Äôre gonna go in for something sweet -  they use unrefined sugars too\n\nWe had hot chocolate with spices which included ginger and cinnamon. It was not spicy like spicy hot just perfectly balanced.  We also had golden hot shots. They serve them with a side of  apple slice  Some of my favorite hot shots ever.\n\nI usually come to this place a couple of times every time I‚Äôm in Paris. I miss it when I am away.\n\nCharlie, the owner with the beautiful smile and great energy is always helpful with me as I struggle with my French;  her first language is English as she hails from London\n\nThe staff is fantastic. Congratulate Charlie on creating such a fabulous addition to the Parisian food scene. Make a reservation for the weekend and enjoy their vegan eggs Benedict or get it with chicken eggs if you prefer. Benedict sauce is vegan, which is fantastic.\n\nDuring the week you can just pop in.\n\nThe street is cute and not busy; enjoy their  tables outside.\n\nThey just celebrated three years. Congratulations and thank you again.\n\nBack again. September 2024.  Check out that avocado rose with my tofu scramble so good.     This place is consistently excellent!!   (Open bright interior  with kind  friendly team - clearly Charlie set the tone and brings in great people.).\n\nThis place is welcoming to locals, and tourist. The street is so sweet. Don‚Äôt miss this place especially if you appreciate organic healthy delicious food",
            "This restaurant is a cute small restaurant in one of the streets of France. This street is packed with vegetarian and vegan restaurants.. you must try this place because they serve good food and it‚Äôs worth a try. Definitely recommendable.",
            "I really enjoyed in this place,it was great experience they have Gluten free option,and it stuff was very polite and friendly ,thats the reason I visited it twice in November and ,when I was back in December. Definitely my favorite brunch place in Paris!!"
